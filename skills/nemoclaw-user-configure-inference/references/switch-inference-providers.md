# Switch Inference Models at Runtime

import { AgentOnly } from "../_components/AgentGuide";

Change the active inference model while the sandbox is running.
You do not need to restart the sandbox.

## Prerequisites

- A running NemoClaw sandbox.
- The OpenShell CLI on your `PATH`, which NemoClaw uses under the hood.

## Switch to a Different Model

<AgentOnly variant="openclaw">
Use `nemoclaw inference set` with the provider and model that match the upstream you want to use.
The command updates the OpenShell inference route and synchronizes the running agent config.
For OpenClaw, it updates `agents.defaults.model.primary` and the matching provider namespace.
</AgentOnly>
<AgentOnly variant="hermes">
Use `nemoclaw inference set` with the provider and model that match the upstream you want to use.
The command updates the OpenShell inference route and synchronizes the running agent config.
For Hermes, it updates `/sandbox/.hermes/config.yaml` (`model.default`, `model.base_url`, `model.provider: custom`, API-family mode when needed, and the OpenShell proxy API-key placeholder) without rebuilding or restarting Hermes.
Pass `--sandbox <name>` when you do not want to use the default registered sandbox.
Under `nemoclaw`, pass `--sandbox <name>` when you have registered more than one Hermes sandbox.
</AgentOnly>

<AgentOnly variant="openclaw">
Pass `--sandbox <name>` when you do not want to use the default registered sandbox.
</AgentOnly>

### NVIDIA Endpoints

```bash
nemoclaw inference set --provider nvidia-prod --model nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b
```

### OpenAI

```bash
nemoclaw inference set --provider openai-api --model gpt-5.4
```

### Anthropic

```bash
nemoclaw inference set --provider anthropic-prod --model claude-sonnet-4-6
```

### Google Gemini

```bash
nemoclaw inference set --provider gemini-api --model gemini-2.5-flash
```

### Compatible Endpoints

If you onboarded a custom compatible endpoint, switch models with the provider created for that endpoint:

```bash
nemoclaw inference set --provider compatible-endpoint --model <model-name>
```

```bash
nemoclaw inference set --provider compatible-anthropic-endpoint --model <model-name>
```

<AgentOnly variant="hermes">

### Hermes Provider

For a NemoClaw-managed Hermes sandbox, use the Hermes alias with the registered Hermes Provider route:

```bash
nemoclaw inference set --provider hermes-provider --model openai/gpt-5.4-mini
```

</AgentOnly>

### API Family Sync

Before patching the in-sandbox config, NemoClaw resolves the target route's API family: OpenAI chat completions, Anthropic Messages, or OpenAI Responses.
For OpenClaw, `inference set` syncs the provider API family and primary model reference into the running config.
For Hermes, `inference set` writes `model.api_mode: anthropic_messages` for Anthropic Messages routes, `model.api_mode: codex_responses` for OpenAI Responses routes, and removes `api_mode` for OpenAI-style chat-completions routes.
Hermes also keeps `model.api_key` on the OpenShell proxy placeholder so dashboard and API sessions continue to authenticate through the gateway after a route change.

Amazon Bedrock Runtime routes created through `compatible-anthropic-endpoint` are the exception.
When you switch within the same Bedrock Runtime compatible provider, NemoClaw keeps the route OpenAI-compatible and does not set Hermes to Anthropic Messages mode.

#### Switching from Responses API to Chat Completions

If onboarding selected `/v1/responses` but the agent fails at runtime, re-run onboarding so the wizard re-probes the endpoint and bakes the correct API path into the image.
This can happen when the backend does not emit the streaming events OpenClaw requires.

```bash
nemoclaw onboard
```

Select the same provider and endpoint again.
The updated streaming probe detects incomplete `/v1/responses` support and selects `/v1/chat/completions` automatically.

For the compatible-endpoint provider, NemoClaw uses `/v1/chat/completions` by default, so you do not need an environment variable to keep the safe path.
To opt in to `/v1/responses` for a backend you have verified end to end, set `NEMOCLAW_PREFERRED_API` before onboarding:

```bash
NEMOCLAW_PREFERRED_API=openai-responses nemoclaw onboard
```

**Note:**

`NEMOCLAW_INFERENCE_API_OVERRIDE` patches the config at container startup but does not update the Dockerfile ARG baked into the image.
If you recreate the sandbox without the override environment variable, the image reverts to the original API path.
A fresh `nemoclaw onboard` is the reliable fix because it updates both the
session and the baked image.

## Cross-Provider Switching

<AgentOnly variant="openclaw">
Switching to a different provider family (for example, from NVIDIA Endpoints to Anthropic) also uses `nemoclaw inference set`.
The command updates both the gateway route and the OpenClaw provider namespace in the running sandbox config.
If the in-sandbox config sync fails after the gateway route is updated, NemoClaw keeps the host registry aligned with the gateway and prints a rebuild hint.
Run the rebuild before relying on the running agent if the warning says the image config could not be patched.

```bash
nemoclaw inference set --provider anthropic-prod --model claude-sonnet-4-6 --no-verify
```

</AgentOnly>
<AgentOnly variant="hermes">
Switching to a different provider family (for example, from NVIDIA Endpoints to Anthropic) also uses `nemoclaw inference set`.
The command updates both the gateway route and `/sandbox/.hermes/config.yaml`.
If the Hermes config sync fails after the gateway route is updated, NemoClaw keeps the host registry aligned with the gateway and prints a rebuild hint.
Run the rebuild before relying on the running agent if the warning says the image config could not be patched.

```bash
nemoclaw inference set --provider anthropic-prod --model claude-sonnet-4-6 --no-verify
```

</AgentOnly>

Use `--no-verify` only when OpenShell cannot verify the provider at switch time but you have already confirmed the provider and credential.

## Tune Model Metadata

The sandbox image bakes model metadata (context window, max output tokens, reasoning mode, and accepted input modalities) into `openclaw.json` at build time.
To change these values, set the corresponding environment variables before running `nemoclaw onboard` so they patch into the Dockerfile before the image builds.

| Variable | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `NEMOCLAW_CONTEXT_WINDOW` | Positive integer (tokens) | `131072` |
| `NEMOCLAW_MAX_TOKENS` | Positive integer (tokens) | `4096` |
| `NEMOCLAW_REASONING` | `true` or `false` | `false` |
| `NEMOCLAW_INFERENCE_INPUTS` | `text` or `text,image` | `text` |
| `NEMOCLAW_AGENT_TIMEOUT` | Positive integer (seconds) | `600` |
| `NEMOCLAW_AGENT_HEARTBEAT_EVERY` | Go-style duration (`30m`, `1h`, `0m` to disable) | `unset` (OpenClaw default) |

NemoClaw ignores invalid values and bakes the default into the image.
For Local Ollama, onboarding loads the selected model first and uses Ollama's reported runtime context length when `NEMOCLAW_CONTEXT_WINDOW` is unset.
For local vLLM, onboarding uses the runtime `max_model_len` value when the server reports one and `NEMOCLAW_CONTEXT_WINDOW` is unset.
Use `NEMOCLAW_INFERENCE_INPUTS=text,image` only for a model that accepts image input through the selected provider.
During interactive onboarding, NemoClaw prompts for **Text only** or **Text + Image** when the discovered model name looks multimodal and `NEMOCLAW_INFERENCE_INPUTS` is not already valid.
Non-interactive onboarding uses the environment value or the default `text` setting.

```bash
export NEMOCLAW_CONTEXT_WINDOW=65536
export NEMOCLAW_MAX_TOKENS=8192
export NEMOCLAW_REASONING=true
export NEMOCLAW_INFERENCE_INPUTS=text,image
export NEMOCLAW_AGENT_TIMEOUT=1800
export NEMOCLAW_AGENT_HEARTBEAT_EVERY=0m
nemoclaw onboard
```

<AgentOnly variant="openclaw">

`NEMOCLAW_AGENT_TIMEOUT` controls the per-request inference timeout baked into `agents.defaults.timeoutSeconds`.
Increase it for slow local inference, such as CPU-only Ollama or vLLM on modest hardware.
NemoClaw writes this value into `openclaw.json` during onboarding.
The default sandbox can keep that file writable for agent state, but direct in-sandbox edits are not the supported or durable way to change NemoClaw-managed defaults.
Rebuild the sandbox with `nemoclaw onboard` to apply a new value.

</AgentOnly>
<AgentOnly variant="hermes">

<AgentOnly variant="openclaw">

`NEMOCLAW_AGENT_HEARTBEAT_EVERY` sets `agents.defaults.heartbeat.every`.
This controls OpenClaw's periodic main-session agent turn.
Each interval, the agent wakes up to review follow-ups and read `HEARTBEAT.md` if present in the workspace.
The OpenClaw default is 30 minutes (1 hour for Anthropic OAuth / Claude CLI reuse).
Tune the cadence with a duration string like `5m` or `2h`, or set `0m` to disable the periodic turns entirely.
Disabling also drops `HEARTBEAT.md` from normal-run bootstrap context per upstream behavior, so the model no longer sees heartbeat-only instructions.
NemoClaw writes this value into `openclaw.json` during onboarding.
The in-sandbox `openclaw config set` command is not the supported path for NemoClaw-managed build-time defaults, and a rebuild overwrites direct file edits.
Rebuild the sandbox with `nemoclaw onboard --resume` to apply a new value.

</AgentOnly>
<AgentOnly variant="hermes">

Hermes does not use OpenClaw's `HEARTBEAT.md` wake-up mechanism.
Rebuild the sandbox with `nemoclaw onboard --resume` to apply build-time inference metadata changes.

</AgentOnly>

These variables are build-time settings.
If you change them on an existing sandbox, recreate the sandbox so the new values bake into the image:

```bash
nemoclaw onboard --resume --recreate-sandbox
```

## Verify the Active Model

Use `nemoclaw inference get` to print the provider and model the gateway is currently routing to.
Run it before `nemoclaw inference set` to confirm the starting state, or after a switch to verify the new route.

```bash
nemoclaw inference get
```

Expected output:

```text
Provider: nvidia-prod
Model:    nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b
```

Pass `--json` for machine-readable output.

```bash
nemoclaw inference get --json
```

Expected output:

```json
{
  "provider": "nvidia-prod",
  "model": "nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b"
}
```

The command exits non-zero with `OpenShell inference route is not configured.` when the gateway has no registered inference route.
Run `nemoclaw onboard` to configure one.

Run the status command when you also need sandbox, service, and messaging health:

```bash
nemoclaw <name> status
```

The status output includes the active provider, model, and endpoint with the rest of the sandbox state.

## Notes

<AgentOnly variant="openclaw">

- The host keeps provider credentials.
- The sandbox continues to use `inference.local`.
- `nemoclaw inference set` patches the selected running OpenClaw or Hermes sandbox config and recomputes its config hash.
- Use `nemoclaw onboard --resume --recreate-sandbox` for build-time settings such as context window, max tokens, reasoning mode, heartbeat cadence, or image contents.
- Local Ollama and local vLLM routes use local provider tokens rather than `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Rebuilds of older local-inference sandboxes clear the stale OpenAI credential requirement automatically.
