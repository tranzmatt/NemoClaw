# Agent Instructions

## Project Overview

NVIDIA NemoClaw is an open-source reference stack for running always-on AI agents such as [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) and [Hermes](https://get-hermes.ai/) inside [NVIDIA OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) sandboxes more safely. It provides CLI tooling, a blueprint for sandbox orchestration, and security hardening.

Status: Active development. Interfaces may change without notice.

## Agent Skills

This repo ships agent skills under `.agents/skills/`.
Use `nemoclaw-user-guide` for end-user documentation routing, `nemoclaw-contributor-*` for contributor workflows, and `nemoclaw-maintainer-*` for maintainer workflows.
Load the `nemoclaw-skills-guide` skill for a full catalog and quick decision guide mapping tasks to skills.

## Architecture

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Dual-Language Stack

- **CLI and plugin**: TypeScript (`src/`, `nemoclaw/src/`) with a small CommonJS launcher in `bin/`; ESM in `test/`
- **Blueprint**: YAML configuration (`nemoclaw-blueprint/`)
- **Docs**: Fern MDX for user-facing pages, with Markdown routes exposed by Fern for AI documentation clients
- **Tooling scripts**: Bash and Python

The `bin/` directory uses CommonJS intentionally for the launcher and a few compatibility helpers so the CLI still has a stable executable entry point. The main CLI implementation lives in `src/` and compiles to `dist/`. The `nemoclaw/` plugin uses TypeScript and requires compilation.

### Testing Strategy

Tests are organized into disjoint Vitest projects defined in `vitest.config.ts`:

1. **`cli`** — `src/**/*.test.ts` — CLI unit tests importing source
2. **`integration`** — `test/**/*.test.{js,ts}` — root integration tests importing source; excludes the explicit lanes below
3. **`installer-integration`** — installer tests that spawn real `install.sh` processes
4. **`package-contract`** — `test/package-contract/**/*.test.ts` — the only non-live lane that imports compiled CLI/plugin artifacts
5. **`plugin`** — `nemoclaw/src/**/*.test.ts` — plugin unit tests co-located with source
6. **`e2e-support`** — fast tests for the E2E fixture/support layer
7. **`e2e-live`** — opt-in live targets that mutate real external state
8. **`e2e-branch-validation`** — opt-in validation on an ephemeral Brev instance

When writing tests:

- Root-level tests (`test/`) use ESM imports
- Plugin tests use TypeScript and are co-located with their source files
- Import CLI source from ordinary tests. Put genuine compiled-artifact assertions under `test/package-contract/`.
- Keep project globs disjoint; `npm run test:projects:check` derives membership from Vitest and rejects overlap.
- Write behavior-oriented titles, put local issue references in a final `(#1234)` suffix, and use `npm run test:spec` for the hierarchical specification view.
- Mock external dependencies; don't call real NVIDIA APIs in unit tests
- E2E tests run on ephemeral Brev cloud instances

### Security Model

NemoClaw isolates agents inside OpenShell sandboxes with:

- Network policies (`nemoclaw-blueprint/policies/`) controlling egress
- Credential sanitization to prevent leaks
- SSRF validation (`nemoclaw/src/blueprint/ssrf.ts`)
- Docker capability drops and process limits

Security-sensitive code paths require extra test coverage.

## Code Style and Conventions

### Commit Messages

Conventional Commits required. Enforced by commitlint via prek `commit-msg` hook.

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `perf`, `merge`

### SPDX Headers

Every source file must include an SPDX license header. The pre-commit hook auto-inserts them:

```javascript
// SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright (c) 2026 NVIDIA CORPORATION & AFFILIATES. All rights reserved.
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

For shell scripts use `#` comments. For Markdown use HTML comments.

### JavaScript

- `bin/` launcher and remaining `scripts/*.js`: **CommonJS** (`require`/`module.exports`), Node.js 22.16+
- `test/`: **ESM** (`import`/`export`)
- Biome config in `biome.json`
- Keep function complexity low; existing complexity hotspots are tracked separately
- Unused vars pattern: prefix with `_`

### TypeScript

- Plugin code in `nemoclaw/src/` is linted and formatted by the root Biome config
- CLI type-checking via `tsconfig.cli.json`
- Plugin type-checking via `nemoclaw/tsconfig.json`

### Shell Scripts

- ShellCheck enforced (`.shellcheckrc` at root)
- `shfmt` for formatting
- All scripts must have shebangs and be executable

### No External Project Links

Do not add links to third-party code repositories, community collections, or unofficial resources. Links to official tool documentation (Node.js, Python, uv) are acceptable.

## Git Hooks (prek)

All hooks managed by [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/) (installed via `npm install`):

| Hook | What runs |
|------|-----------|
| **pre-commit** | Cheap structural and file-local checks, including fixers, formatters, and linters |
| **commit-msg** | commitlint (Conventional Commits) |
| **pre-push** | Path-scoped incremental CLI/plugin TypeScript checks and checked-JavaScript checks |

## Working with This Repo

### Before Making Changes

1. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full contributor guide
2. For a first-time checkout, use `.agents/skills/nemoclaw-contributor-onboard/SKILL.md` or run `npm run dev:setup`
3. Run `npm run dev:doctor` to verify the contributor environment without changing it
4. Use `./scripts/dev-setup.sh --expose-cli` only with explicit approval for host-visible CLI exposure
5. Run the tests targeted to the behavior you change once per relevant change set; rerun them after later edits or hook autofixes that can affect that behavior

### Git and GitHub Access Failures

Follow `.agents/skills/_shared/git-github-hard-stop.md`: if SSH, `gh`, authentication, authorization, remote access, or push permission fails, stop and ask the user instead of working around access. Do not stop for ordinary merge conflicts or dirty-worktree state; resolve mechanical conflicts in the relevant workflow and ask the user only when resolution would change behavior or contributor intent.

### Pull Request Follow-Up

Follow `.agents/skills/_shared/pr-follow-up.md`: after opening or pushing to a PR, monitor required CI and automated review comments, address valid CodeRabbit and PR Review Advisor findings, and consult the user when feedback is ambiguous or design-changing.

### Common Patterns

**Adding a CLI command:**

- Entry point: `bin/nemoclaw.js` (launches the compiled CLI in `dist/`)
- Main CLI implementation lives in `src/lib/` and compiles to `dist/lib/`
- Add tests in `test/`

**Adding a plugin feature:**

- Source: `nemoclaw/src/`
- Co-locate tests as `*.test.ts`
- Build with `cd nemoclaw && npm run build`

**Adding a network policy preset:**

- Add YAML to `nemoclaw-blueprint/policies/presets/`
- Follow existing preset structure (see `slack.yaml`, `discord.yaml`)

**Adding model-specific sandbox compatibility:**

- Add a declarative manifest under `nemoclaw-blueprint/model-specific-setup/<agent>/`
- Use one exact `agent` per manifest (`openclaw`, `hermes`, etc.); do not make shared multi-agent manifests
- Put OpenClaw executable wrappers under `nemoclaw-blueprint/openclaw-plugins/`
- Put Hermes executable wrappers under `agents/hermes/`
- Keep `agents/hermes/generate-config.ts` as a thin build-time entrypoint; add Hermes env parsing, config construction, registry handling, and serialization under `agents/hermes/config/`
- Do not add Hermes behavior for an OpenClaw issue without a Hermes-specific repro or acceptance test

### Gotchas

- `npm install` at root triggers `prek install` which sets up git hooks. If hooks fail, check that `core.hooksPath` is unset: `git config --unset core.hooksPath`
- The `nemoclaw/` subdirectory has its own `package.json` and `node_modules`, while sharing the root Biome config — it's a separate npm project
- SPDX headers are auto-inserted by pre-commit hooks; don't worry about adding them manually
- Coverage thresholds are ratcheted in `ci/coverage-threshold-*.json` — new code should not decrease CLI or plugin coverage
- The `.claude/skills` symlink points to `.agents/skills` — both paths resolve to the same content

## Documentation

- Treat `docs/` as the source of truth for user-facing documentation and follow `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- After completing development changes, run a documentation writer subagent before final handoff. Give it the changed files, behavior summary, and test evidence so it can update docs or report that no doc changes are needed.
- For normal docs changes, include source pages under `docs/`.
- Update `.agents/skills/nemoclaw-user-guide/SKILL.md` only when the AI-agent docs routing guidance changes.
- During release prep, run `nemoclaw-contributor-update-docs`, make doc version bumps, and open the docs refresh PR with the docs changes.

## PR Requirements

- Create feature branch from `main`
- Let normal `pre-commit`, `commit-msg`, and `pre-push` hooks provide hook verification before submitting
- Contributor-owned PRs must self-serve the DCO declaration and GitHub commit verification before opening a PR
- Every contributor-owned PR description must include a valid `Signed-off-by:` declaration for the contributor, and every commit in the PR must appear as `Verified` in GitHub
- Contributor agents must stop before `gh pr create` if the PR body will not include the DCO declaration or any commit is missing GitHub verification; tell the contributor to fix the issue before opening a PR
- If force-push is not allowed and an already-published branch contains an unverified commit, require a fresh branch and fresh PR with a clean compliant history
- Run targeted tests once per relevant change set, rerunning after later behavior-affecting edits or hook autofixes, and run `npm run docs` for doc changes
- Count successful normal hooks as verification; if hooks were skipped or unavailable, refresh `origin/main` and use `npm run check:diff`
- Follow PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`)
- No secrets, API keys, or credentials committed
- Limit open PRs to fewer than 10
