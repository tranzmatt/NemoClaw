# Prerequisites

Before getting started, check the prerequisites to ensure you have the necessary software and hardware to run NemoClaw.

## Hardware

| Resource | Minimum        | Recommended      |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| CPU      | 4 vCPU         | 4+ vCPU          |
| RAM      | 8 GB           | 16 GB            |
| Disk     | 20 GB free     | 40 GB free       |

The sandbox image is approximately 2.4 GB compressed. During image push, the Docker daemon, k3s, and the OpenShell gateway run alongside the export pipeline. The pipeline buffers decompressed layers in memory. On machines with less than 8 GB of RAM, this combined usage can trigger the OOM killer. If you cannot add memory, configuring at least 8 GB of swap can work around the issue at the cost of slower performance.

## Software

| Dependency | Version                          |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Node.js    | 22.16 or later |
| npm        | 10 or later |
| Docker     | Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, or Colima on a tested platform |
| Platform   | See [Platforms](#platforms) below |

On Linux, the installer can install Docker, start the Docker service, and add your user to the `docker` group.
If the group change is not active in the current shell, the installer exits with `newgrp docker` guidance before it starts onboarding.
If you choose the native Linux Ollama install path, the onboard wizard also requires `zstd` for Ollama archive extraction.

On Debian and Ubuntu, NemoClaw installs `zstd` with `apt-get` if it is missing; on other Linux distributions, install `zstd` before onboarding.

On macOS, NemoClaw uses the Docker-driver OpenShell gateway path with Docker Desktop or Colima.
You do not need to install or sign a separate OpenShell VM driver helper for standard macOS onboarding.

:::{warning} OpenShell Lifecycle
For NemoClaw-managed environments, use `nemoclaw onboard` when you need to create or recreate the OpenShell gateway or sandbox.
Avoid `openshell self-update`, `npm update -g openshell`, `openshell gateway start --recreate`, or `openshell sandbox create` directly unless you intend to manage OpenShell separately and then rerun `nemoclaw onboard`.
:::

:::{note} Docker storage driver
On Linux hosts running Docker 26 or later with the [containerd image store](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/containerd/) enabled (the install-time default for fresh `docker-ce` installations on Ubuntu 24.04 and similar distros), `nemoclaw onboard` transparently builds a `fuse-overlayfs`-enabled cluster image to bypass a kernel-level nested-overlay limitation in k3s.
No manual setup is required.
See the [troubleshooting guide](../reference/troubleshooting.md) for the override knobs and a manual `daemon.json` alternative.

## Platforms

The following table lists tested platform and runtime combinations.
Availability is not limited to these entries, but untested configurations can have issues.
The table is generated from [`ci/platform-matrix.json`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/blob/main/ci/platform-matrix.json), the single source of truth kept in sync by CI and QA.

## Next Steps

- [Prepare Windows for NemoClaw](windows-preparation.md) if you are using Windows.
