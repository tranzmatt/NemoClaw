# Backup and Restore Workspace Files

Workspace files define your agent's personality, memory, and user context.
They persist across sandbox restarts but are **permanently deleted** when you run `nemoclaw <name> destroy`.

This guide covers snapshot commands, manual backup with CLI commands, and an automated script.

## When to Back Up

- **Before running `nemoclaw <name> destroy`**
- Before major NemoClaw version upgrades
- Periodically, if you've invested time customizing your agent

## Snapshot Commands

The fastest way to back up and restore sandbox state is with the built-in snapshot commands.
Snapshots capture all workspace state directories defined in the agent manifest and store them in `~/.nemoclaw/rebuild-backups/<name>/`.

```console
$ nemoclaw my-assistant snapshot create
$ nemoclaw my-assistant snapshot list
$ nemoclaw my-assistant snapshot restore
```

`snapshot list` prints a table of version, name, timestamp, and path. Versions (`v1`, `v2`, ..., `vN`) are computed from the timestamp order, so `vN` is always the newest snapshot.

To tag a snapshot with a human-readable label, pass `--name`:

```console
$ nemoclaw my-assistant snapshot create --name before-upgrade
```

To restore a specific snapshot instead of the latest, pass a version, name, or timestamp prefix:

```console
$ nemoclaw my-assistant snapshot restore v3
$ nemoclaw my-assistant snapshot restore before-upgrade
$ nemoclaw my-assistant snapshot restore 2026-04-14T
```

The `nemoclaw <name> rebuild` command uses the same snapshot mechanism automatically.
For full details, see the [Commands reference](../reference/commands.md).

## Manual Backup

Use `openshell sandbox download` to copy files from the sandbox to your host.

```console
$ SANDBOX=my-assistant
$ BACKUP_DIR=~/.nemoclaw/backups/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
$ mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

$ openshell sandbox download "$SANDBOX" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/SOUL.md "$BACKUP_DIR/"
$ openshell sandbox download "$SANDBOX" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/USER.md "$BACKUP_DIR/"
$ openshell sandbox download "$SANDBOX" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/IDENTITY.md "$BACKUP_DIR/"
$ openshell sandbox download "$SANDBOX" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md "$BACKUP_DIR/"
$ openshell sandbox download "$SANDBOX" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/MEMORY.md "$BACKUP_DIR/"
$ openshell sandbox download "$SANDBOX" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/memory/ "$BACKUP_DIR/memory/"
```

## Manual Restore

Use `openshell sandbox upload` to push files back into a sandbox.

```console
$ SANDBOX=my-assistant
$ BACKUP_DIR=~/.nemoclaw/backups/20260320-120000  # pick a timestamp

$ openshell sandbox upload "$SANDBOX" "$BACKUP_DIR/SOUL.md" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/
$ openshell sandbox upload "$SANDBOX" "$BACKUP_DIR/USER.md" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/
$ openshell sandbox upload "$SANDBOX" "$BACKUP_DIR/IDENTITY.md" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/
$ openshell sandbox upload "$SANDBOX" "$BACKUP_DIR/AGENTS.md" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/
$ openshell sandbox upload "$SANDBOX" "$BACKUP_DIR/MEMORY.md" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/
$ openshell sandbox upload "$SANDBOX" "$BACKUP_DIR/memory/" /sandbox/.openclaw/workspace/memory/
```

## Using the Backup Script

The repository includes a convenience script at `scripts/backup-workspace.sh`.

### Backup

```console
$ ./scripts/backup-workspace.sh backup my-assistant
Backing up workspace from sandbox 'my-assistant'...
Backup saved to /home/user/.nemoclaw/backups/20260320-120000/ (6 items)
```

### Restore

Restore from the most recent backup:

```console
$ ./scripts/backup-workspace.sh restore my-assistant
```

Restore from a specific timestamp:

```console
$ ./scripts/backup-workspace.sh restore my-assistant 20260320-120000
```

## Verifying a Backup

List backed-up files to confirm completeness:

```console
$ ls -la ~/.nemoclaw/backups/20260320-120000/
AGENTS.md
IDENTITY.md
MEMORY.md
SOUL.md
USER.md
memory/
```

## Multi-Agent Deployments

When OpenClaw is configured with multiple named agents, each agent has its own
workspace directory (`workspace-main/`, `workspace-support/`, `workspace-ops/`,
and so on — see [Multi-Agent Deployments](workspace-files.md#multi-agent-deployments)).

`nemoclaw <name> snapshot create` automatically discovers every `workspace-*/`
directory under the sandbox state tree and includes it in the snapshot bundle
alongside the default `workspace/`. `snapshot restore` re-applies the full
per-agent set. No manual per-workspace backup pattern is needed.

The sandbox entrypoint ensures every per-agent workspace is backed by the
persistent `.openclaw-data/` tree (via a symlink from
`.openclaw/workspace-<name>/`) so state also survives `openshell sandbox restart`.

### Shared files across agents

Files that operators typically want consistent across every per-agent workspace
(`AGENTS.md`, shared skills, common templates) are **not** synced automatically.
Each workspace is independent; changes in one don't propagate. Operators that
need this either copy the shared files explicitly to each workspace after
editing, or maintain a host-side sync layer. Tracking shared-file tooling
(shared mount, `workspaces list` command) in
[#1260](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/issues/1260).
