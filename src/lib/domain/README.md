# Domain helpers

Domain modules contain pure policy and decision logic. They should not import oclif, spawn processes, read host state directly, or call Docker/OpenShell.

Preferred layout:

```text
src/lib/domain/<area>/<topic>.ts
src/lib/domain/<area>/<topic>.test.ts
```

Flat files are acceptable for small cross-cutting helpers, but workflow-specific logic should live under an area directory that matches the command/action stack when practical:

```text
src/commands/internal/<area>/<verb>.ts
src/lib/actions/<area>/<verb>.ts
src/lib/domain/<area>/<topic>.ts
```

Configuration export represents retained startup intent from a validated managed-image receipt.
Preserve image authority and full residual profile comparison when admitting a supported setting.

Managed OpenClaw exports `agents[].tools.disclosure: direct` only when the registry selection agrees with
the validated startup profile. Absent or explicit `progressive` selection keeps
the canonical omission. Model compatibility can still downgrade runtime tool
behavior. Preserve managed-image authority and full residual profile equality;
admitting disclosure must not admit extra tool gateways or minimal-bootstrap settings.
Hermes keeps its canonical export without `tools`; a retained direct selection or
profile is unsupported even when those two sources agree.

One read-only secondary OpenClaw agent can share the primary hosted route on Docker.
Runtime `main` remains the sole default and exports as `primary`; the secondary keeps
its compatible, nonreserved ID and exports `tools: {allow: [read]}`. The generator
and exporter use the same manifest normalizer in `src/lib/extra-agents-validation.ts`.
Canonical workspace paths stay implicit. Verify the whole retained manifest before
admitting that leaf in the residual profile comparison; other agent settings still
need their own supported projection. Apply the new pair and route constraints only
to documents using `tools.allow`, preserving existing v1 agent shapes.

Managed OpenClaw exports `agents[].interfaces.dashboard` when the retained port agrees with the
registry and remote bind agrees with recorded preparation. Port 18789 and loopback bind are omitted.
Legacy registry entries may omit the port only for the canonical loopback/default-port profile.
Custom URLs, WSL exposure and device-auth changes remain unsupported. Export does not establish
that a dashboard listener is currently running.

`config/verify-agent-interfaces.ts` owns retained dashboard and API checks for both agents.
Each agent has a closed `interfaces` schema; Hermes adds dashboard enablement, internal port,
browser TUI and API port. Enabled Hermes dashboards require matching registry settings and an
allocated API port. The existing registry row publishes that allocation with the lifecycle
generation and sandbox fingerprint, which the export verifier checks against live identity.
Pending reservations and mismatched or changing evidence cannot authorize export.

Hermes omits disabled dashboards, false TUI, public port 18789, internal port 19119 and API port
8642 from canonical output. Legacy disabled profiles may omit the API allocation; enabling the
dashboard requires an explicit allocation. Dashboard ports retain the onboarding parser's
restrictions, including API ports 8642–8652, port 18642 and equal public/internal ports. Export
describes retained intent and does not inspect current processes or require a running host forward.

OpenClaw telemetry supports an enabled local OTLP/HTTP collector at
`http://host.openshell.internal:4318`, a printable ASCII service name of 1–256 characters without
edge spaces, and a sample rate from 0 to 1. Canonical disabled telemetry is omitted. Other disabled
settings, Unicode service names, remote collectors, headers, and credentials remain unsupported.
Export preserves the observed effective policy, including local collector rules, without adding
permissions or claiming collector health.
