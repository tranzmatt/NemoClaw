/**
 * The legal onboarding transition graph.
 *
 * There are exactly two families of edges and no others:
 *
 * 1. Direct edges (`ONBOARD_MACHINE_DIRECT_TRANSITIONS`) — the forward flow
 *    plus the `inference -> provider_selection` retry and the
 *    `sandbox -> {openclaw,agent_setup}` branch. `kind` is `advance`, `retry`,
 *    or `branch`.
 * 2. Failure edges (`ONBOARD_MACHINE_FAILURE_TRANSITIONS`) — every non-terminal
 *    state may transition to `failed`. `kind` is `failure`.
 *
 * Terminality invariant: `complete` and `failed` are terminal and have no
 * outgoing edges. In particular there is deliberately **no** edge out of
 * `failed` into any agent/flow state, so a completed-then-reopened session can
 * never take an invalid `failed -> <agent>` transition (#6179).
 *
 * Recovery model: resuming an interrupted run does not transition out of a
 * terminal state. Instead a single, side-effect-free recovery pass
 * (`applySessionRecovery`) validates and re-seats the durable snapshot at a
 * legal non-terminal entry state before any flow handler runs and writes a
 * deterministic recovery receipt. After `onboard.resumed`, the runtime makes a
 * best-effort `state.repair.completed` dispatch attempt for that receipt. A
 * restart before the next transition retries the same receipt ID. Terminal
 * states therefore stay terminal within the graph while recovery remains
 * explicit and observable.
