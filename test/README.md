# Test Directory

The test directory uses execution lanes first and behavior areas second.

## Execution lanes

| Directory | Vitest project | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `installer-integration/` | `installer-integration` | Tests that spawn the real installer process |
| `package-contract/` | `package-contract` | Tests that import compiled CLI or plugin artifacts |
| `e2e/support/` | `e2e-support` | Deterministic tests for E2E fixtures and support code |
| `e2e/live/` | `e2e-live` | Opt-in tests that mutate external state |

Other `*.test.js` and `*.test.ts` files outside the dedicated lanes above belong to the `integration` project.
The project globs in `vitest.config.ts` must remain disjoint and exhaustive.

## Shared test code

- Put passive inputs in `fixtures/`.
- Put deterministic reusable utilities in `helpers/`.
- Put stateful harnesses, fake services, and process setup in `support/`.
- Keep one-test companion modules with their owning test when practical.

## Adding tests

Choose the execution lane from the boundary that the test exercises.
Within the integration project, group new tests by the behavior that owns the assertion.
For example, `process-recovery/` owns sandbox process and forward recovery coverage, `channels/` owns channel lifecycle coverage, and `credentials/` owns host credential storage and reset coverage.
Do not put an ordinary integration test in `e2e/` or `package-contract/`.

Run `npm run test:projects:check` after adding or moving a test.
