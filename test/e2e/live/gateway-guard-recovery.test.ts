 * Live E2E: gateway guard-chain recovery after pod-recreate /tmp wipe.
 *
 * Regression guard for NVIDIA/NemoClaw#2701. The historical recovery shell
 * took a "warn-and-proceed" branch when `/tmp/nemoclaw-proxy-env.sh` was
 * missing: it logged `[gateway-recovery] WARNING` and launched the gateway
 * naked. On
 * aarch64 / DGX Spark this triggers an infinite crash loop in
 * `@homebridge/ciao` (`os.networkInterfaces()` throws because the OpenShell
 * netns blocks the syscall). The only manual recovery is a 5-min
 * `nemoclaw <name> rebuild --yes`.
 *
 * This test asserts the desired contract — recovery logs that it is restoring
 * from trusted packaged preloads, RESTORES the guard chain before launching,
 * and keeps the gateway PID stable. It will fail on `main` (proving the bug),
 * pass once the fix lands.
 *
 * The contract is platform-independent: we don't need aarch64 to assert
 * "guards are present after recovery." The aarch64 ciao crash is a
 * downstream consequence of the same broken contract.
 *
 * #2701 acceptance scope for this PR:
 *   - Covered: the default OpenClaw production recovery route
 *     (`nemoclaw <sandbox> connect --probe-only` →
 *     checkAndRecoverSandboxProcesses() → authenticated PID 1 supervisor)
 *     after the pod-recreate-equivalent state
 *     of an empty guard-chain `/tmp` plus no running gateway process. This
 *     proves the user no longer needs `nemoclaw <sandbox> rebuild --yes` for
 *     that recovered runtime state.
 *   - Deliberately out of scope for this merge gate: physical DGX Spark /
 *     GB10 / aarch64 hardware, provider breadth beyond `cloud-openclaw`, and
 *     destructive host reboot / OOM / supervisor crash / manual
 *     `kubectl delete pod` triggers. The current live Vitest runner exposes a
 *     Docker-driver OpenShell sandbox and does not provide a stable per-test
 *     Kubernetes pod handle that can be deleted without destabilizing shared
 *     gateway state. Those trigger/hardware/provider clauses need a dedicated
 *     platform-runtime job; this test locks down the shared recovery contract
 *     they all depend on.
 *
 * This Vitest coverage owns both the #2478 WARNING assertion lineage and the
 * #2701 guard-chain assertion.
