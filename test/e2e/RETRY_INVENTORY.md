# Live E2E retry inventory

| Operation | Owner | Limit | Retry condition | Safety basis | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `external-gateway-health.tcp-readiness` | `openshell-gateway` | 10 attempts, one second apart | The newly started gateway listener rejects a TCP connection with `ECONNREFUSED` | The probe is read-only. Other errors stop without retry. The Blueprint Runner health operation runs once after the listener opens. | `external-gateway-readiness-retry.json` |
| `openclaw-plugin-runtime-exdev.onboard-pairing` | `openclaw-plugin-runtime-exdev` | One attempt | None. | If fresh onboarding reports missing canonical CLI device pairing or a bounded CLI scope warm-up failure, the test attempts to record structured failure diagnostics and then write `failed-no-retry` evidence. An evidence write failure fails the test and may leave that artifact absent. It does not automatically resume an ambiguously mutated onboarding session. | `openclaw-plugin-exdev-onboard-retry.json` |
| `openclaw-plugin-runtime-exdev.recreate-pairing` | `openclaw-plugin-runtime-exdev` | One attempt | None. | If recreation reports either condition, the test attempts to record structured diagnostics and then write `failed-no-retry` evidence. An evidence write failure fails the test and may leave that artifact absent. The test does not automatically retry after failure classification. A later attempt requires a new test invocation. | `openclaw-weather-plugin-recreate-retry.json` |
| `mcp-bridge.tool-discovery` | `test/e2e/live/mcp-bridge-tool-discovery.ts` | 2 attempts, one second apart | Discovery reports `failureClass: connection` before any request reaches the fixture | The operation lists tools without calling them. Any fixture request or other failure class stops the retry. | First-attempt and `retry-2` command artifacts plus `*-mcp-tool-discovery-diagnostics.json` |
