# NemoClaw E2E CI

Direct E2E coverage runs through Vitest.

Interactive TUI targets require `expect`. The unified workflow installs it
before those targets run; local runners must provide it themselves.

- `.github/workflows/e2e.yaml` selects the default workflow E2E jobs on each push
  to `main` and supports trusted manual dispatches for specific PR head commits.
  Push runs skip the Jetson nvmap and DGX Spark llama.cpp jobs because their
  required workflow dispatch flags cannot be set by a push event.
- `.github/workflows/hosted-runner-recovery.yaml` evaluates first-attempt
  failures from approved `main` workflows and requests one full rerun only when
  every non-passing job has authenticated GitHub-hosted runner-loss evidence.
- `.github/workflows/e2e-main-retry.yaml` evaluates eligible `E2E main` push
  attempts, requests at most two failed-job reruns, and uploads attempt evidence.
- The `staging-brev-launchable` job in `.github/workflows/e2e.yaml` validates
  the baked candidate without installing or copying NemoClaw source.
- `.github/workflows/macos-e2e.yaml`, `.github/workflows/wsl-e2e.yaml`, and
  `.github/workflows/sandbox-images-and-e2e.yaml` call focused E2E targets directly.
  `.github/workflows/e2e.yaml` selects free-standing jobs, including
  `whatsapp-qr-compact` and `ollama-auth-proxy`.

## CI execution shape

### Candidate CLI Artifact

The candidate CLI comes from the source commit that an E2E run tests.
The `generate-matrix` job builds it once.
The job publishes root `dist/` and `nemoclaw/dist/shared/` in one content-addressed artifact.
The boundary validator derives artifact consumers from jobs that use the pinned preparation action.
It excludes `generate-matrix` and the no-build and trusted-build jobs in `E2E_JOB_POLICY`.
Each selected consumer restores the artifact instead of running `npm run build:cli`.
Each consumer runs the pinned preparation action with `build-cli: "false"` to install Node.js and project dependencies.
The `managed-image-protected-runtime` qualification does not use this artifact.
It builds the CLI from the trusted workflow checkout and never executes or restores the candidate CLI.

#### Artifact Identity

For a pull request (PR) run, `checkout_sha` identifies the candidate source commit.
The trusted workflow runs from `github.workflow_sha`.
A push or manual run uses `github.sha` when `checkout_sha` is empty.

The artifact manifest records these values:

- The candidate repository and commit SHA.
- The trusted workflow SHA, run ID, and attempt.
- The source tree and lockfile digests.
- The Node.js and npm versions, runner platform, and build command.
- The payload digest.

The artifact name contains the candidate commit SHA and payload SHA-256 digest.
The `generate-matrix` job emits one `nemoclaw-e2e-cli-provenance-v1` JSON object through its `cli_artifact_provenance` output.
Each artifact-using job passes that object as the restore action's only `provenance-json` input.

Each artifact-using job invokes the repository-owned `restore-e2e-cli-artifact` composite action at a full commit SHA.
The workflow does not load the action implementation from the candidate checkout.
Before download, the action rejects extra or missing provenance fields.
The action requires the candidate checkout SHA, repository, workflow SHA, and run ID to match the provenance object.
The producer attempt must not be newer than the consumer attempt.
The action downloads the artifact by immutable ID and sets digest mismatch handling to `error`.

Before the action restores root `dist/` and `nemoclaw/dist/shared/` into the workspace, it verifies these conditions:

- The upload digest is present and well formed.
- The candidate SHA matches the expected commit.
- The manifest matches the source, workflow run, toolchain contract, and payload.
- The archive contains no path traversal, links, special files, or files outside root `dist/` and `nemoclaw/dist/shared/`.
- Neither root `dist/` nor `nemoclaw/dist/` already exists, including as a dangling symbolic link.
- The candidate checkout's `nemoclaw/` path is a directory and is not a symbolic link.
- The CLI entry point and required shared modules are nonempty regular files.
- The staged `dist/build-identity.json` names the candidate commit SHA.

If a pre-restore check fails, the action stops before it adds either directory to the workspace.
After the checks pass, the action restores root `dist/` and `nemoclaw/dist/shared/`, then runs `bin/nemoclaw.js --version`.
If the version command fails, the action stops before the live test runs.
This boundary keeps candidate source separate from the trusted workflow implementation.

#### Timing Baseline

The pre-change baseline uses GitHub Actions `Build CLI` step timings from these workflow runs:

| Workflow run | Job | Tested candidate | `Build CLI` duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [30574154335](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/actions/runs/30574154335) | `cloud-inference` | `385f598` | 18.740 seconds |
| [30574154335](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/actions/runs/30574154335) | `cloud-onboard` | `385f598` | 18.793 seconds |
| [30503498077](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/actions/runs/30503498077) | `Shared E2E (vllm-docker-storage)` | `d52d459` | 18.756 seconds |

The three observed build steps have a median duration of 18.756 seconds.
This baseline measures only the replaced build step.
Artifact upload, download, validation, and the dependency on `generate-matrix` add runtime and can affect the workflow critical path.
Do not use the build-step median to claim savings in runner time or workflow elapsed time.

A manual PR E2E run tests candidate code but executes `.github/workflows/e2e.yaml` from `main`.
The PR run cannot measure this workflow change before merge.
After merge, use a passing `main` run and complete these steps:

1. Match the job selection, runner labels, and first attempt to the baseline.
2. Record durations for the candidate build, artifact upload, artifact download, combined verification and restore step, job, and workflow.
3. Sum affected step durations for runner-time comparison.
4. Compare matched job and workflow elapsed times.
5. Identify each result by workflow run, tested commit SHA, trusted workflow SHA, and attempt.

Do not substitute a theoretical value for post-change CI evidence.

#### Historical Fixtures

The historical fixtures retain these version boundaries:

| Fixture | Required boundary |
| --- | --- |
| `openshell-gateway-upgrade` | Retain the historical installer commit and SHA-256 digest, sandbox image digest, and reviewed OpenClaw npm URL and SHA-512 integrity. Install the historical package before testing the candidate upgrade path. |
| `rebuild-openclaw` | Retain the reviewed old-base build in the target. Build and create the old sandbox before testing the candidate rebuild path. |

These targets may restore the shared artifact for the candidate CLI.
They must not replace a historical installer, package, image, or version boundary with that artifact.
The gateway fixture already binds its remote historical inputs to immutable commits and cryptographic digests.
The workflow does not republish those inputs as artifacts.

### Hermes Sandbox Image Artifact

The sandbox image workflow builds the Hermes production image in the dedicated
30-minute `build-hermes-sandbox-image` job. It uses full-SHA-pinned Buildx
actions and a GitHub Actions cache scoped to the runner OS and architecture.
The producer adds a bounded 32 GiB swap file and validates the guarded
production build arguments before the build. It loads the image locally with
registry writes disabled. After the build, it scans the completed image for
node-tar and verifies the sandbox-readable installed files. It then uploads the
compressed image as the one-day `hermes-isolation-image` artifact.

The 90-minute `test-hermes-sandbox-image` job and the
`state-dir-guard-metadata` job download and load that artifact instead of
rebuilding the image. Within the Hermes test job, the secret-boundary and
root-entrypoint steps have 45- and 30-minute budgets respectively.

The former top-level `test/e2e/test-*.sh` suite has been removed. Keep real
shell, installer, process, Docker, OpenShell, `/proc`, and sandbox boundaries in
E2E tests when those boundaries are the behavior under test.

## Platform Vitest main watch

`.github/workflows/platform-vitest-main.yaml` runs the full Vitest suite in
four independent shards on each of macOS and WSL, with `fail-fast` disabled.
Each macOS shard has a 30-minute budget and each WSL shard has a 90-minute
budget. The additional root-required WSL contracts run only on shard 1.

## Retired Brev source-install coverage

Issue #7490 retired the generic Brev source-install lane. The unified workflow
and exact-staging Launchable job own its product coverage:

| Legacy suite | Disposition | Current owner |
|---|---|---|
| `full` | Launchable E2E | `staging-brev-launchable` runs `full-e2e` in preinstalled mode against the exact baked candidate. |
| `credential-sanitization` | Unified E2E | `credential-sanitization` |
| `telegram-injection` | Unified E2E | `telegram-injection` |
| `messaging-providers` | Unified E2E | `messaging-providers` |
| `messaging-compatible-endpoint` | Unified E2E | `messaging-compatible-endpoint` |
| `dashboard-remote-bind` | Unified E2E | `dashboard-remote-bind` owns install, onboard, artifacts, and terminal cleanup. |
| `gpu` | Unified E2E | `gpu-e2e` runs on the dedicated GPU runner. |
| `all` | Retired | The selector only duplicated `credential-sanitization` and `telegram-injection`. |

The retired nightly caller no longer runs. Each push to `main` starts a workflow that selects the default workflow E2E jobs.
Manual GPU validation must use `gpu-e2e`.
It must not provision a generic Brev VM.

## Credential-free tests

Credential-free tests that can use the standard Ubuntu runner, CLI build, and
artifact policy opt into the shared E2E job with a tag beside the test:

```typescript
// @module-tag e2e/credential-free
```

Discovery reads tagged files from the `e2e-live` and `integration` Vitest
projects. It derives each test ID from the filename and supplies only the ID,
repository-relative file, and Vitest project to the test matrix. Keep the
filename stem unique and lowercase kebab-case. Do not add the test to a separate
catalog or manually maintained workflow matrix.

The E2E workflow owns the shared job's runner, timeout, setup, permissions,
secrets, and artifact handling. Keep a dedicated workflow job when a test needs
different capabilities, such as credentials, a custom runner, additional setup,
or a different timeout.

Both `jobs` and `targets` selectors continue to accept the test ID. Run the
discovery command locally to inspect the generated test matrix:

```bash
npx tsx tools/e2e/credential-free-tests.mts
```

## Inactive Windows MXC OpenClaw qualification

`windows-mxc-openclaw-process-container.test.ts` is an explicit local
qualification target for epic #8178. It exercises an operator-supplied native
Windows OpenShell package and a staged OpenClaw artifact through the OpenShell
`process_container` driver. It does not register MXC, call `wxc-exec.exe`
directly, or establish Windows support.
The generated driver configuration requests the stricter less-privileged
AppContainer mode and records that choice in the receipt.

The target requires a Windows x64 host that passes the minimum MXC candidate
check. It rejects a dirty NemoClaw checkout and requires exact expected
identities for that checkout, the OpenShell CLI and gateway, the
OpenShell-supplied `wxc-exec.exe`, the complete OpenClaw artifact tree, Node.js,
and the OpenClaw entrypoint. Compute the canonical artifact-tree digest after
staging:

```powershell
npx tsx tools/e2e/windows-mxc-openclaw-artifact-tree.mts $env:NEMOCLAW_WINDOWS_MXC_OPENCLAW_ROOT
```

Set the following environment variables to paths or exact lowercase identity
values. Do not put credentials in them.

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `E2E_ARTIFACT_DIR` | Existing directory for the secret-free qualification receipt |
| `NEMOCLAW_E2E_EXPECTED_SHA` | Exact 40-character NemoClaw checkout revision |
| `NEMOCLAW_WINDOWS_MXC_OPENSHELL_CLI` | Extracted `openshell.exe` path |
| `NEMOCLAW_WINDOWS_MXC_OPENSHELL_GATEWAY` | Extracted `openshell-gateway.exe` path |
| `NEMOCLAW_WINDOWS_MXC_WXC_EXEC` | `wxc-exec.exe` supplied for that OpenShell package |
| `NEMOCLAW_WINDOWS_MXC_OPENSHELL_VERSION` | Exact OpenShell package version |
| `NEMOCLAW_WINDOWS_MXC_OPENSHELL_REVISION` | Exact 40-character OpenShell source revision |
| `NEMOCLAW_WINDOWS_MXC_OPENSHELL_CLI_SHA256` | Expected OpenShell CLI SHA-256 |
| `NEMOCLAW_WINDOWS_MXC_OPENSHELL_GATEWAY_SHA256` | Expected OpenShell gateway SHA-256 |
| `NEMOCLAW_WINDOWS_MXC_WXC_EXEC_SHA256` | Expected `wxc-exec.exe` SHA-256 |
| `NEMOCLAW_WINDOWS_MXC_OPENCLAW_ROOT` | Staged native OpenClaw artifact root |
| `NEMOCLAW_WINDOWS_MXC_NODE` | Node.js executable beneath the artifact root |
| `NEMOCLAW_WINDOWS_MXC_OPENCLAW_ENTRY` | OpenClaw entrypoint beneath the artifact root |
| `NEMOCLAW_WINDOWS_MXC_OPENCLAW_VERSION` | Expected OpenClaw version |
| `NEMOCLAW_WINDOWS_MXC_OPENCLAW_ARTIFACT_TREE_SHA256` | Expected canonical artifact-tree SHA-256 |
| `NEMOCLAW_WINDOWS_MXC_NODE_SHA256` | Expected Node.js SHA-256 |
| `NEMOCLAW_WINDOWS_MXC_OPENCLAW_ENTRY_SHA256` | Expected OpenClaw entrypoint SHA-256 |

The target creates a random OpenClaw gateway token for readiness checks. It
passes that token through the MXC agent environment; current OpenShell
`process_container` packaging can therefore expose its encoded configuration,
including the token, to privileged host process inspection while `wxc-exec.exe`
starts the sandbox. The token is never written to the receipt or supplied in
the OpenClaw command arguments, is not reused, and is useful only for the
temporary loopback OpenClaw gateway. Cleanup attempts sandbox deletion, stops
the recorded OpenClaw process, clears the in-memory environment value, and
removes the runtime home, state, configuration, and gateway logs. A direct
process-tree termination is an emergency cleanup fallback only. The host-side
OpenShell processes receive an allowlist of Windows runtime variables rather
than the complete caller environment. Before using a termination fallback,
the host binds the process ID to the expected executable, command arguments,
and creation time. For OpenClaw, it also validates the probe-parent ancestry.
The host rejects a mismatched or reused PID. The fallback uses the
`taskkill.exe` beneath the validated Windows system root. If either the
OpenClaw process or OpenShell gateway needs that fallback, the qualification
fails. The delete retry and process-termination paths are failure containment,
not compatibility workarounds that permit a passing result; their presence does
not assume a specific upstream defect. Remove them only when failed or partial
OpenShell lifecycle operations can still guarantee teardown without host-side
cleanup.

Run only the explicit target:

```powershell
$env:NEMOCLAW_RUN_LIVE_E2E = "1"
$env:NEMOCLAW_RUN_WINDOWS_MXC_OPENCLAW_E2E = "1"
npx vitest run --project e2e-live test/e2e/live/windows-mxc-openclaw-process-container.test.ts
```

The target verifies OpenClaw startup and in-sandbox health, read-write and denied
filesystem behavior, registry cleanup, and termination of the recorded
OpenClaw process on sandbox delete. After preflight and local setup succeed, it
writes a secret-free receipt for either verdict and records whether sensitive
runtime artifacts were removed. When that cleanup succeeds, a failed run retains
only non-sensitive probe files for diagnosis.
Gateway mTLS, governed egress, managed inference, gateway-restart recovery, and
production activation remain outside this target.

The retired `hermes-dashboard` selector remains a compatibility alias for
`hermes-e2e` in both selector inputs. Reports use the canonical
`hermes-e2e` name. That lane always enables dashboard coverage while preserving
the manually selected `mock`, `internal-nvidia`, or `public-nvidia` inference
mode.

## Current OpenClaw plugin EXDEV lifecycle

The `openclaw-plugin-runtime-exdev` job keeps one current-version lifecycle:

1. Onboard the custom weather plugin as v1.
2. Restart the gateway and verify v1.
3. Recreate the sandbox with the plugin changed to v2.
4. Run the cross-device runtime-dependency replacement probe.

The recreation remains the replacement boundary. It verifies the v2 plugin
with runtime inspection, `tools.catalog`, and `tools.invoke`, and it preserves
the workspace marker. The job also keeps the test-only tmpfs mount, unchanged
stock policy-source bytes, and the distinct-device and source-side `EXDEV`
checks. The duplicate v3 rebuild is removed from this job. The
`rebuild-openclaw` job remains the canonical live rebuild coverage.

The current-checkout fixture locally prebuilds its repository-controlled v1
and v2 Dockerfiles with BuildKit, then hands only those local image references
to OpenShell. User-supplied `--from` Dockerfiles retain the gateway-builder
trust boundary and are never host-prebuilt by this fixture.

The runtime target for `openclaw-plugin-runtime-exdev` is 16–17 minutes.
Push-run timing for the reduced lifecycle has not yet been measured.

## Larger-runner routing

The larger-runner experiment is inactive while the configuration variable
`E2E_LARGER_RUNNER_LABEL` is unset. In that state, every eligible lane continues
to use `ubuntu-latest`. The trusted `generate-matrix` job builds one runner map
before checking out test code, and it consumes the variable only when the
workflow repository is `NVIDIA/NemoClaw`, the ref is `refs/heads/main`, and
no alternate checkout SHA is requested. Manual PR E2E dispatches therefore remain on
standard runners even though they use the trusted workflow definition from
`main`.

Manual PR E2E dispatches and direct push or manual `main` runs use a
bounded swap fallback for eligible hosted Hermes image-building lanes. The
fallback does not change runner routing. The trusted workflow provisions the
fallback as the first job step, before checking out or executing the selected
revision. Manual PR E2E requires a maintainer-supplied lowercase 40-character
checkout SHA plus matching trusted workflow and dispatch revisions. Direct-main
mode rejects alternate checkout and workflow revisions and requires the
workflow source to match the run revision. Both modes require an ephemeral
GitHub-hosted Linux x64 runner. Candidate code cannot supply the program or
arguments passed to `sudo`.

The trusted step requires at least 32 GiB (34,359,738,368 bytes) of usable swap.
It reuses active swap that meets this requirement.
Otherwise, it preserves at least 16 GiB of available disk capacity under
`/mnt`, creates a root-owned mode-`0700` directory, and creates an exclusive
randomized mode-`0600` file.
The file allocation is 32 GiB plus 4,096 bytes (34,359,742,464 bytes).
The additional 4,096 bytes keep the usable swap capacity at or above 32 GiB
after formatting.
Setup failure stops before candidate checkout and removes partial state only
after proving the file inactive or successfully disabling it.
After `swapon` succeeds, the trusted step makes up to five activation
observations, one second apart.
If visibility remains stale, cleanup treats the file as active.
Cleanup removes it only after `swapoff` succeeds.
Successful state is discarded with the ephemeral runner.

The fallback covers agent-turn latency, Hermes inference switch and shields,
the Hermes stable MCP shard, the Hermes common-egress and channel
stop/start shards, the dashboard-bearing `hermes-e2e` lane, `hermes-discord`,
and Hermes security-posture tests. Rebuild lanes with workflow-managed swap,
dedicated-runner lanes, `mcp-bridge-dev`, and non-Hermes shards do not use it.
Candidate-authored workflow definitions and fork-owned runs cannot reach it.

The fallback exists because the alternate-checkout trust boundary deliberately
keeps PR-authored code from selecting the administrator-managed larger-runner
label; changing the PR checkout cannot safely grant itself that capacity.
Remove the fallback only after trusted `main` and manual PR E2E runs use
ephemeral GitHub-hosted runners with at least 32 GB RAM without weakening the
source guards, and five consecutive runs of every protected lane complete
without runner loss while runner-pressure telemetry reports less than 1 GiB of
swap used.

The eligible set is limited to the measured or repeatedly interrupted heavy
lanes:

- `common-egress-agent`;
- `hermes-e2e`, including dashboard coverage, and `hermes-discord`;
- the Anthropic-compatible `hermes-inference-switch` mode;
- `hermes-shields-config`;
- the Hermes shards of `security-posture` and `channels-stop-start`;
- `rebuild-hermes`;
- `rebuild-hermes-stale-base`;
- the `hermes` and `deepagents` shards of `mcp-bridge`.

The OpenClaw shards of the matrix jobs, the `openclaw` MCP shard,
`mcp-bridge-dev`, and `openshell-credential-generation-window` remain on
`ubuntu-latest`; unrelated jobs retain their existing runner assignments.
The credential-generation window runs as an independent fresh-runner job in
parallel with the stable MCP agent matrix. Empty-selector dispatches and
explicit `mcp-bridge` selections run both jobs, while the credential-window job
keeps its own exact-release provenance, secret scan, and artifact.
Before setting the variable, an organization owner must:

1. Create a GitHub-hosted Ubuntu x64 larger runner with 8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM, and
   300 GB SSD in a dedicated runner group.
2. Set the group maximum concurrency to 4 and restrict repository access to
   `NVIDIA/NemoClaw` and workflow access to
   `NVIDIA/NemoClaw/.github/workflows/e2e.yaml@refs/heads/main`.
3. Record at least five standard-runner samples for each eligible lane,
   including queue time, execution time, peak CPU, memory and disk use,
   infrastructure failures, and estimated cost.
4. Copy the larger runner's workflow label into the repository variable, then
   repeat the same measurements for at least five representative executions
   per migrated lane.

Clearing `E2E_LARGER_RUNNER_LABEL` is the rollback. It sends the eligible lanes
back to `ubuntu-latest` without changing selectors, test setup, or test
semantics. Do not replace this experiment with a persistent self-hosted runner;
that requires a separate decision.

## Push operations

The consolidated workflow keeps its operational reporting in the same job
graph as the live targets:

- GitHub Actions run history is the authoritative record for push and
  manual E2E results.
- Automated issue routing and the workflow's `issues: write` capability are
  retired. Any future issue escalation should use a separately reviewed
  exceptional threshold, such as the same lane failing twice consecutively or
  remaining broken for 24 hours, rather than posting on every failed schedule.
- `scorecard` writes the push/manual result summary and posts it to the
  daily or full-run Slack route. The summary:
  - separates queue time from execution time for the ten jobs with the longest
    combined duration;
  - reports the runner class as `standard`, `larger`, or `unknown` without
    exposing runner labels;
  - adds this run's semantic phase runtime table;
  - compares each of the ten slowest current tests with up to ten prior
    completed push runs; and
  - compares the trusted cloud-onboard timing summary with the latest
    prior-release `e2e.yaml` run.
- The push comparison reads only validated `e2e-runtime-summary.json`
  artifacts retained for 14 days. Manual runs can display the comparison but
  never enter its baseline. The table reports the current outcome, prior median
  and p95, prior pass/fail/skip counts and rates, the failure streak including
  the current run, and the most common failed phase across the compared runs.
  It marks a total or phase regression only when the current duration exceeds
  the prior median by both at least 20% and at least 30 seconds.
- A separate flake watch shows at most five current tests that both passed and
  failed across the current run and up to ten prior completed push runs.
  It ranks them by pass/fail flips and then failure count. It reports
  pass/fail/skip counts, failure rate, pass/fail flips, current failure streak,
  and the most common failed phase. The failure-rate denominator and
  pass/fail-flip count exclude skips.
- Selective dispatches remain silent unless they run on `main` with
  `post_to_slack=true`, which uses the preview Slack route. Branch-dispatched
  runs never receive Slack webhook secrets.

A manual run with `jobs=staging-brev-launchable` runs only `Exact staging Brev
Launchable`. Each push run also selects this job as part of the complete main run.

A manual run with `include_staging_brev_launchable=true` and empty `jobs` and
`targets` selectors runs the default workflow E2E selection plus the Launchable E2E job.
This is the full run required for pre-tag evidence. Each full dispatch uses
`github.run_id` in its workflow concurrency identity, so another full dispatch
cannot supersede it while it waits. The trusted `main` workflow dispatch
verifies that the dispatching and rerunning actors have repository `maintain` or
`admin` permission before the Launchable path's source checkout. That automatic
role check authorizes `staging-brev-launchable`; the job does not use GitHub
environment approval. The job uses the non-cancelling
`staging-brev-launchable-cpu` group with `queue: max`, so pending Launchable E2E
runs remain queued instead of replacing one another.

The Jetson nvmap and DGX Spark llama.cpp jobs remain excluded from ordinary and
full runs unless their independent runner-queue flags are `true`.
A user permitted to dispatch this workflow may set either flag, but only after
a repository administrator confirms the corresponding runner is online in the
authoritative repository runner inventory.
Set `allow_jetson_runner_queue=true` to select `jetson-nvmap-gpu`.
Set `allow_dgx_spark_runner_queue=true` to select both
`llama-cpp-dgx-spark-plan` and `llama-cpp-dgx-spark-qualification`.
GitHub can pause the qualification job for the
`approve-dgx-spark-image-qualification` environment before it reaches the DGX
Spark runner.
Pre-tag evidence requires both runner-queue flags to remain `false`.
Results from opt-in hardware runs do not enter the required pre-tag E2E
denominator.

### Hosted-Runner Recovery

Hosted Runner Recovery can request one full rerun for eligible WSL, macOS, and
platform-watch push runs. It does not handle `E2E main`. The complete non-passing
job listing must contain only authenticated hosted-runner-loss evidence for the
workflow's approved runner labels. An ordinary assertion failure, mixed failure
set, incomplete listing, custom or self-hosted label, changed evidence, or
ambiguous pagination prevents recovery.

For eligible `E2E main` push runs, `E2E / Main Retry` asks GitHub Actions to rerun failed jobs and their dependent jobs.
A successful CLI artifact producer is not rerun.
The workflow retains its CLI artifact for 3 days.
During that period, consumers can reuse the immutable, content-addressed artifact from an earlier producer attempt in the same workflow run.
If the artifact is unavailable when a consumer downloads it, restoration fails because the failed-job rerun does not rerun the successful producer.
Restore validation binds the producer provenance to the workflow run, workflow SHA, and candidate checkout.
It downloads by immutable artifact ID and verifies the manifest and the payload digest.
It rejects a producer attempt newer than the consumer attempt.
The controller can request two reruns.
It does not verify that GitHub schedules a different runner, so do not treat a rerun as evidence of a fresh host.
It ignores manual runs and source runs superseded by a newer `main` push.
The controller checks out only trusted default-branch code and receives no repository secrets.

The runner-allocation and internal-error failures handled by Hosted Runner
Recovery originate in GitHub Actions, outside repository-controlled workflow
code. Hosted Runner Recovery contains these failures without claiming to repair
their source. Remove `.github/workflows/hosted-runner-recovery.yaml` and its
controller only after the three platform workflows record 30 consecutive days
with no first-attempt failure accepted by the recovery classifier, or after those
workflows stop using GitHub-hosted runners. Each accepted Hosted Runner Recovery
request resets that observation window.

### Runner comparison telemetry

Trusted `main` runs without an alternate checkout SHA record runner-comparison
telemetry for 12 routed workflow lane identities / 14
concrete job executions.

- `agent-turn-latency`, spanning its sequential OpenClaw and Hermes setup
- `common-egress-agent` with the `openclaw-balanced-weather`,
  `openclaw-open-reference`, and `hermes-open-reference` shards
- `rebuild-hermes`
- `rebuild-hermes-stale-base`
- `mcp-bridge` with the `hermes` shard
- `mcp-bridge` with the `deepagents` shard
- `channels-stop-start` with the `hermes` shard
- `hermes-discord`
- `hermes-e2e`, including dashboard coverage
- `hermes-inference-switch` with the `anthropic` mode
- `hermes-shields-config`
- `security-posture` with the `hermes` shard

The two extra executions come from `common-egress-agent`, which runs three
scenario shards.
The OpenClaw matrix entries for `mcp-bridge`,
`channels-stop-start`, and `security-posture` are not instrumented.
The #7145 standard-versus-larger-runner cohort compares the same lane and
equivalent workload while varying the runner class. The newly instrumented
`agent-turn-latency` extends diagnostic coverage; this does not route it to a
larger runner.

Each execution writes one bounded, ordered v2 time series to the canonical
`runner-comparison.jsonl` ledger. It contains:

- an `initialize` endpoint after exact-commit artifact restoration; the rebuild
  jobs initialize after their fixed-capacity swap;
- a distinct `scenario-start` for every test handled by the execution;
- a `periodic` sample on an approximately 15-second fixed cadence for
  `rebuild-hermes` and `rebuild-hermes-stale-base`, and an approximately
  60-second fixed cadence for every other execution;
- a `phase` sample before each semantic phase transition and when the final
  phase stops; and
- a `finalize` endpoint from an `always()` step immediately before artifact
  checking and upload.

The progress pulse owns both stall reporting and periodic comparison sampling,
so it never creates a second timer. Phase samples that cross a periodic deadline
consume that slot, and delayed probes skip missed slots instead of producing a
catch-up burst. Each successful append also prints one bounded
`E2E_RUNNER_COMPARISON_SAMPLE` line in the job log.

The v2 ledger accepts at most 256 samples. Ordinary sampling stops once 255
records exist to reserve the last slot for `finalize`. A missing, historical-v1,
already-finalized, full, or invalid ledger permanently disables comparison
sampling for that test progress instance. The two Hermes rebuild lanes use their
shorter cadence to improve Docker/BuildKit peak-RSS evidence without changing
the ledger bound, schema, privacy contract, or reserved final slot. In
`rebuild-hermes` and `rebuild-hermes-stale-base`, where legacy phase resource
evidence is configured, the workflow establishes its 32 GiB swap before
`initialize` so the ledger sees one stable swap capacity. If canonical sampling
becomes unavailable, the existing five-minute full snapshot becomes the
best-effort fallback.
That full profile may run `ps`, `docker stats`, and `docker system df`
sequentially with a 15-second timeout each, or 45 seconds in the worst case;
canonical sampling suppresses this heavier collection while it remains active.
Other lanes stop canonical sampling without creating a second evidence stream.
Historical v1 ledgers and summaries remain readable, but a v1 ledger cannot be
extended or mixed with v2 samples.

Probe cost depends on the sample kind. `initialize` and `finalize` read only
kernel and filesystem sources and launch no child process. `periodic` adds one
one-second `ps` probe and does not call Docker. `scenario-start` and `phase`
samples add the same bounded process probe plus two-second `docker stats` and
`docker system df` probes. The emitted schema contains only numeric fields,
fixed process classes (`docker-buildkit`, `openshell`, or `other`), and fixed
sample metadata, including the explicit target and shard labels. It never
records process or container names, command lines, child output, or arbitrary
environment and secret values. Docker memory evidence is reduced to the largest
retained container value; maximum Docker CPU considers every row in the bounded
command output. When the globally largest process is in the Docker/BuildKit
class, the collector also reads that process's `VmRSS`, `RssAnon`, `RssFile`,
`RssShmem`, and optional `VmSwap` values from procfs. PID and exact process
identity remain private to the collector, and the breakdown is `null` if the
process exits, its identity changes, procfs denies access, or the resident
components are incomplete or inconsistent. The outer `rssKb` is the `ps`
selection and ranking observation; `breakdown.vmRssKb` is the immediately
following procfs observation and may differ when a live process changes memory.

The finalizer validates the complete ledger before writing
`runner-comparison-summary.json`. The v2 summary reports the sampled window from
`initialize` until immediately before artifact scanning or upload. Initialization
follows artifact restoration and any required rebuild swap. For the Hermes
`security-posture` shard, the window includes OpenShell installation and
installer-backed NemoClaw setup, but not workspace preparation or artifact restoration.
The summary reports CPU average and busiest interval; one-minute load;
available, cached, reclaimable, swap, root-cgroup current/peak/limit, and
endpoint OOM-counter evidence; memory and I/O pressure; workspace bytes and
inodes; Docker image, container, and build-cache usage; largest container
memory and CPU; and the largest fixed process class by RSS. Extrema include the
semantic phase where they were observed when attribution is sound. CPU
intervals ending at a `scenario-start` remain unattributed because they can
span two tests, and extrema whose selected observation is `initialize` have a
`null` phase. OOM deltas are also `null` unless both endpoint counters are
available. Unsupported or unreadable measurements are `null`.

The largest-process summary carries the breakdown from the same sample that
provided the maximum total RSS; it does not combine per-component maxima from
different samples. Treat this as an approximate breakdown of one process's RSS,
not as a Docker/BuildKit process-tree working set: file-backed RSS can count
shared mappings in more than one process, and this evidence excludes host page
cache and sibling processes.

The root-cgroup peak is a lifetime counter that includes Docker siblings but
can also include host activity before the measured window. Compare it only
across runs with the same runner setup. Canonical v2 `memory.availableKb` comes
only from `/proc/meminfo` `MemAvailable` and is `null` when that field is
unavailable. Separately, the adjacent progress/stall resource line falls back
to the portable free-memory value and labels that value as `memory free`.

The comparison time series is diagnostic-only and is not an input to terminal
classification or retry policy. Runner-comparison telemetry does not affect
`E2E / Main Retry` decisions. Hosted Runner Recovery remains limited to
authenticated runner-loss evidence for its three platform workflows.

Treat a missing summary as unavailable evidence, not as low utilization. A
hard runner loss can prevent finalization or artifact upload. When you compare
standard and larger runners, use runs with the same commit SHA, workflow
inputs, target, and shard. Pair the artifact with the GitHub Actions runner
label, queue time, result, and usage or cost metadata. The ledger is a time
series for one execution only; this telemetry does not maintain cross-run
rolling history or write to the GitHub Actions step summary. Both output files
are private regular files on the runner (`0600`) with strict per-line and total
size limits.

Raw cloud-onboard traces stay under the runner temporary directory. Before
artifact upload, `scripts/e2e/sanitize-trace-timing.py` reduces them to the
allowlisted `cloud-onboard-trace-timing-summary.json` timing schema and deletes
the raw directory. Aggregation ratchets require `report-to-pr` and `scorecard`
to wait for the same execution-job set.

Registry-driven Vitest targets also enable onboard trace collection. Each live
matrix target writes raw traces under the runner temporary directory, sanitizes
them before upload, deletes the raw trace directory, and uploads only
`e2e-artifacts/live/<target>/cloud-onboard-trace-timing-summary.json` with the
target artifact. These per-target summaries are artifact evidence only; the
Slack/GitHub scorecard comparison remains tied to the dedicated `cloud-onboard`
artifact so baseline aggregation stays stable.
Older issue references to Vitest target artifacts under `e2e-artifacts/vitest/`
map to this consolidated `e2e-artifacts/live/` registry-target artifact layout.

Every `e2e-live` test and every credential-free integration test selected by
the shared E2E workflow planner declares an ordered semantic phase plan in
`meta.e2ePhases` and uses its automatic progress fixture. Normal E2E output
identifies the workflow target and test scenario, then shows immediate phase
start and completion lines with both phase and total elapsed time. A transition
looks like:

```text
[e2e target="cloud-onboard" scenario="onboards a hosted sandbox"] [phase 2/4] completed: onboard the sandbox — passed in 2m 14s (total 2m 21s)
[e2e target="cloud-onboard" scenario="onboards a hosted sandbox"] [phase 3/4] started: verify hosted inference (total 2m 21s; phase 0s)
```

For `e2e-live`, the stateful fixture appends `release registered E2E resources`
after the test-declared plan, so the displayed phase count includes that
terminal phase. Registered cleanup duration, failures, and stall diagnostics
are attributed there. Workflow-selected integration tests instead declare and
enter their own final release phase. Soft assertion failures remain attributed
to the semantic phase in which they occurred rather than being reassigned to
resource release.

If one phase remains active for five minutes, a content-free diagnostic adds
the target/scenario identity, total and phase duration, age of the last child
output, current redacted command or cleanup activity, and runner resources. It
repeats every ten minutes while that same phase remains active. Automatic child
output observation forwards only a timestamp and stream name, never contents.
Operations with bounded retries may emit immediate content-free
`progress.event(...)` lines for a timeout, cleanup, backoff, or retry; event
labels are explicitly logged and must never contain child output, request data,
credentials, or tokens.

During fixture teardown, the fixture writes `test-progress.json` into each
test's existing artifact directory for passing and failing tests. The summary
keeps the test identity and overall timestamps, plus each recorded phase's
timestamps, duration, outcome, child-output event count, and last-output timestamp.
It records the target from `E2E_TARGET_ID`, falling back to the Actions
`GITHUB_JOB` identity, and records `NEMOCLAW_E2E_SHARD` when set. Compare
extracted artifacts from multiple runs with:

```bash
npm run test:runtime-audit -- path/to/run-1 path/to/run-2
```

The audit groups each test by target and optional shard, ranks the groups by
p95 runtime, and reports variability plus the slowest observed phase's duration
and outcome. Push and ordinary manual runs include the same table for that
run in the GitHub Actions scorecard summary. Their push trend uses only the
bounded timing and outcome summary rather than downloading historical raw test
artifacts. Keep phase labels specific to test behavior, call
`progress.phase("literal phase label")` at the declared boundaries in order,
and transition through the final test-declared phase on every passing path.
Both fixtures reject a passing test that never reaches that phase; only the
stateful live fixture enters its resource-release phase automatically.
Validate phase coverage without executing test bodies with:

```bash
npm run test:e2e-phases:check
```

### DGX Spark Express vLLM

`spark-express-vllm.test.ts` is a physical-host qualification for the second DGX Spark Express inference option, the catalog-backed fixed vLLM profile.
It requires a qualified NVIDIA DGX Spark with Docker, NVIDIA Container Toolkit, OpenShell prerequisites, enough storage for the pinned image and model, and no unrelated `nemoclaw-vllm` container.
The target accepts only a local Docker socket and the default Docker context, rejects remote selectors, and treats Docker inspection errors as preflight failures instead of absent resources.
The target sources `scripts/install.sh` from the candidate checkout, calls the Express option-selection functions with option 2, and invokes the candidate CLI directly for onboarding.
It does not run the hosted installer bootstrap, clone or ref selection, dependency installation, CLI exposure, or the real terminal prompt.
Separate installer tests own those earlier boundaries.
The live target refuses to replace a pre-existing sandbox or `nemoclaw-vllm` container.
It preserves the shared Hugging Face cache, records the created sandbox and container identities, and revalidates each identity before cleanup.
If onboarding exits nonzero, the target captures the managed-container log tail and sandbox details before cleanup.
The standard E2E artifacts retain bounded command output.

Run the target from a clean candidate checkout on the Spark host:

```bash
E2E_JOB=1 \
E2E_TARGET_ID=spark-express-vllm \
NEMOCLAW_RUN_LIVE_E2E=1 \
NEMOCLAW_SANDBOX_NAME=e2e-spark-vllm \
npx tsx tools/e2e/live-vitest-invocation.mts run \
  --test-path test/e2e/live/spark-express-vllm.test.ts
```

A passing target establishes that the source-checkout option-2 path selects the fixed vLLM preset and recipe, the managed container carries exact catalog provenance and the exact catalog-derived serve command, `inference.local` completes a chat request, and unrelated sandbox egress receives an HTTP `403` response.

The checker preserves coverage for every file under `test/e2e/live/` and adds
workflow-selected integration files from the authoritative shared-job planner.
Live modules import `fixtures/e2e-test.ts`; selected integration modules import
`fixtures/workflow-e2e-test.ts` and declare their final release phase explicitly.
It also follows shared E2E runtime helpers. Run child processes through
`ShellProbe` or an existing audited progress-aware boundary; new direct async
process boundaries fail the check. Synchronous calls require both a positive
timeout shorter than the first heartbeat and `killSignal: "SIGKILL"`. Keep child
contents in redacted artifacts and report only timestamp-based output activity
to the console. Pass the fixture-provided frozen, canonical `progress`
capability unchanged to an audited subprocess boundary; do not replace it with
a custom, copied, or no-op adapter.

## Push and Manual PR E2E

E2E does not run automatically for pull requests.
Pull requests retain deterministic CI, including the `e2e-support` Vitest project.
Each push to `main` selects the default workflow E2E jobs.
The central workflow skips the Jetson nvmap and DGX Spark llama.cpp jobs on push.
The central workflow has no scheduled trigger.

The main-push selection includes:

- the staging Brev Launchable journey;
- the OpenShell gateway authentication contract;
- the development MCP bridge;
- managed-image startup on AMD64 and ARM64;
- managed-image GPU, Ollama, NVIDIA NIM, and vLLM behavior;
- Hermes GPU startup.

These jobs retain their runner, credential, evidence, and cleanup boundaries.
A main push can queue repository-owned GPU runners and can create Brev resources.
The retry workflow reruns failed jobs at most twice.

Each trusted push to `main` selects `Exact staging Brev Launchable`. The job reads
these credentials from repository Actions secrets:

- `BREV_API_KEY` authenticates the Brev CLI for workspace operations in the
  organization identified by `BREV_ORG_ID`.
- `NEMOCLAW_IMAGE_DISPATCH_TOKEN` is exposed as `GH_TOKEN` only to the trusted
  host script. It grants Actions read/write access to `brevdev/nemoclaw-image`,
  which the script uses to dispatch the image workflow, inspect its run, and
  download its handoff artifact.
- `NVIDIA_INFERENCE_API_KEY` is exported into the Brev guest for the full E2E
  process. Code in the baked candidate checkout can read and use it.

These credentials remain valid until they expire or an administrator revokes
them in their issuing services. If cleanup fails, remove the recorded Brev
workspace. Rotate or revoke each credential to remove later access.

When an eligible `E2E main` push workflow concludes with `failure`, `E2E / Main Retry` asks GitHub Actions to rerun failed jobs and their dependent jobs.
The controller permits two reruns but does not verify that GitHub schedules a different runner.
After evaluation succeeds, it uploads an artifact named for the current attempt.
The artifact contains one `attempts` summary for each source attempt through the current attempt.
The `totalRunnerMinutes` field contains the cumulative runner time for those summaries.
A later successful attempt sets `action` to `passed-after-retry` and `flaky` to `true`.
The controller does not retry manual PR runs or a run superseded by a newer `main` push.

For a PR revision run, a repository maintainer or administrator leaves `jobs` and `targets` empty. The run selects:

- every default-selected free-standing workflow E2E except `Exact staging Brev Launchable`;
- every shared credential-free test; and
- these controller-selected registry targets: `ubuntu-policy-custom-missing-presets-negative`, `ubuntu-repo-cloud-langchain-deepagents-code`, `ubuntu-repo-cloud-openclaw`, and `ubuntu-repo-docker-post-reboot-recovery`.

The run skips `jetson-nvmap-gpu`, `llama-cpp-dgx-spark-plan`, and
`llama-cpp-dgx-spark-qualification` unless their separate runner-queue flags
are `true`.
The trusted workflow definition remains on `main` and binds the candidate head to the current PR base SHA.
It does not run GitHub's synthetic merge commit.

PR Review Advisor maps changes to either of these shared journaled-recreation handlers to recommended E2E coverage:

- `src/lib/onboard/machine/handlers/sandbox-resume.ts`.
- `src/lib/onboard/machine/handlers/sandbox.ts`.

The risk plan selects the `openshell-gateway-upgrade` job and the
`ubuntu-repo-cloud-langchain-deepagents-code` typed target. The job covers the
installer-driven OpenShell gateway upgrade handoff. The target covers the
LangChain Deep Agents Code sandbox recreation path.

An empty-selector manual run exposes these values to candidate-controlled job processes:

- Long-lived API keys from repository secrets: `NVIDIA_INFERENCE_API_KEY`, `NVIDIA_API_KEY`, and `BRAVE_API_KEY`.
- Long-lived messaging credentials from repository secrets: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_REAL`, `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_REAL`, `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN_REAL`, and `SLACK_APP_TOKEN_REAL`.
- The job-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the `token-rotation` and `openshell-gateway-upgrade` jobs. It has `checks: read`, `contents: read`, and `pull-requests: read` access. Candidate code can use it while either job runs. GitHub Actions invalidates it after the job.
- Messaging account and channel identifiers from repository secrets: `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_IDS`, `TELEGRAM_AUTHORIZED_CHAT_IDS`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID_E2E`, `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID_E2E`, and `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID_E2E`.

The workflow does not rotate or revoke these API keys or messaging credentials. To remove later access, rotate or revoke every listed credential in the external service that issued it. The workflow cannot erase identifiers copied by candidate code. Review the complete candidate diff before dispatch.
Live targets can create external resources.
After a failure, inspect the workflow artifacts and remove resources that target cleanup did not remove.

For `managed-image-protected-runtime`, the workflow supplies the long-lived `NVIDIA_API_KEY` repository secret only to the trusted qualification step. Trusted host code uses it for NGC login and passes it as `NGC_API_KEY` and `NIM_NGC_API_KEY` to the temporary NIM container. Candidate managed sandboxes receive generated local route tokens instead of this key. The live fixture attempts to stop and remove `nemoclaw-managed-image-nim-e2e`, but Docker stop or removal errors do not fail the test. A surviving container can retain the API key until runner teardown. The final workflow step removes the job's isolated Docker credential directory and fails if that removal does not complete. The workflow does not revoke the NVIDIA API key. Rotate or revoke it in the issuing NVIDIA service to remove later access.

For a manual PR run, provide the current PR number, lowercase 40-character head SHA, head repository, lowercase 40-character base SHA, trusted `main` workflow SHA, and a review reason containing 10 to 500 printable characters.
Leave `jobs` and `targets` empty and keep `include_staging_brev_launchable=false` to use this PR revision selection.
Keep `allow_jetson_runner_queue=false` and `allow_dgx_spark_runner_queue=false` for the default PR revision selection.
If `allow_dgx_spark_runner_queue=true`, GitHub can pause the qualification job for the `approve-dgx-spark-image-qualification` environment.
An authorized environment reviewer must approve it before qualification starts.
To select the protected managed-image runtime qualification, set `jobs=managed-image-protected-runtime`.
Leave `targets` empty.
Keep `include_staging_brev_launchable=false`.
The exact candidate must contain `ci/protected-managed-image-multiarch-activation-v1.json` and `ci/protected-managed-image-runtime-activation-v1.json`.
The trusted pre-checkout step requires current `maintain` or `admin` permission and validates the exact open PR and selected mode before candidate code runs.
A second validation after checkout rejects a changed head, base, or repository before preparation.

The Actions run is advisory for the pull request and is not a required merge context.
Treat it as passing evidence only when the `E2E` workflow concludes with `success` for the recorded PR number, head repository, head SHA, base SHA, and trusted workflow SHA.
A changed head repository, head SHA, or base SHA invalidates the evidence and requires a new manual run.

The macOS and WSL workflows also run on configured pushes to `main`.
The portable-profile workflow runs on `main` when one of its configured paths changes.
Their manual dispatch paths remain available for branch diagnosis.

## Onboard performance budget

The push/manual scorecard evaluates the trusted `cloud-onboard` timing
summary against `ci/onboard-performance-budget.json`. The budget covers the
warm-system path and is advisory: exceeding the total-duration cap or a
regression threshold emits a GitHub Actions warning and adds details to the run
summary, but does not fail the scorecard job.

The config separates the absolute total-duration budget from total and phase
regression thresholds. Phase regressions are diagnostic and are only compared
when the current run and prior-release baseline contain the same known onboard
phase names. Cold image pulls, first-time model downloads, provider outages,
and runner or network incidents can still affect the signal, so maintainers
should inspect the timing table before acting on a warning.

For PRs, the unified PR Review Advisor builds and renders guidance from the
deterministic risk plan for the PR SHA and changed-file set. It
recommends jobs for known regression families and includes `cloud-onboard` when
changes affect onboard behavior, trace timing, scorecard analysis, budget
configuration, or the unified E2E workflow. Compatibility schema fields may
classify that guidance as required, but rendered advisor guidance remains
non-authoritative. Model advice is additive and cannot downgrade the
deterministic floor. PR Review Advisor recommendations remain advisory.
A maintainer decides whether to dispatch this trusted selection for the current PR
revision. No PR E2E controller dispatches the risk plan.

The `full-e2e` target enforces a separate hard acceptance contract for the
first fresh onboarding path in that job. It measures from the onboard root span
(a conservative anchor before wizard step `[1/8]`) through the first non-empty
agent response, requires the local BuildKit prebuild for the NemoClaw-generated
context without a gateway-builder fallback, enforces the calibrated root and
phase limits in the budget file, and limits the longest onboard output gap to
60 seconds. A violation fails
`full-e2e`, and the target writes its evidence to `onboard-progress-budget.json`.
The artifact records the first-turn command wall clock and OpenClaw's internal
agent duration separately. Older or malformed OpenClaw output records an
explicit unavailable reason instead of fabricating a duration.
The artifact also identifies the model, provider, inference mode, and prompt contract.
When every deterministic cold-onboard budget passes and the real first turn exits
successfully with the expected sentinel, a sole root-end-to-first-turn overage
is recorded as a structured, non-blocking hosted-latency anomaly rather than a
PR regression.
The same overage remains blocking when accompanied by a root-start or
phase-budget failure.

The trusted push scorecard stores the current eligible sample in the
`e2e-runtime-summary` artifact.
The scorecard compares only samples with the same agent, provider, model,
inference mode, and prompt contract.
The recurrence window contains the 12 most recent eligible samples from
push `main` runs.
The current anomaly fails the scorecard when the window is full and contains at
least one earlier anomaly.
A current sample without an anomaly does not fail because of an earlier anomaly.
Missing, malformed, or functionally unsuccessful samples do not enter the window.
The scorecard waits for 12 eligible samples when retained history is incomplete.
The canonical E2E uploader retains each push summary for 14 days.

When changed base-image inputs require the authoritative local OpenClaw base
build, the target applies the separately calibrated 90-second allowance only to
the root-start and sandbox-phase limits. The installer must emit the exact local
base-build reason before the allowance applies. Published-image runs retain the
normal limits, and output silence, first-turn, and all other phase requirements
remain unchanged.

The two Hermes rebuild jobs and both reusable-workflow Hermes image exporters
add a bounded 32 GiB swap file on their ephemeral hosted runners before the
memory-heavy image build. The rebuild fixture verifies that floor and
provisions the same swap file on GitHub Actions when a trusted control-plane
run uses the workflow definition from `main`. Those paths build large Hermes
image layers and can otherwise exhaust the runner's default memory and swap
during Docker layer export. Apart from those rebuild and export paths, E2E jobs
add swap only through the trusted Hermes main-workflow fallback described in
[Larger-runner routing](#larger-runner-routing).

These assertions run inside the existing `full-e2e` lifecycle instead of a
second standalone onboarding run. This keeps the measurement on the job's first
sandbox build, avoids warming Docker layers before a duplicate performance
test, and makes `full-e2e` the source of truth for the hard cold-path contract.
