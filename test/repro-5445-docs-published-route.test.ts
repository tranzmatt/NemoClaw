// Route-level regression for NemoClaw#5445: the OpenClaw commands reference page
// linked to `../deployment/install-openclaw-plugins`, which mirrors the target's
// SOURCE directory (`docs/deployment/install-openclaw-plugins.mdx`) rather than
// its PUBLISHED nav section. Fern serves that page under the `manage-sandboxes`
// section, so the source-directory link 404s on the live site even though the
// file exists on disk. `fern check` and source-path checks (PR #6290) missed it.
//
// These assertions exercise behavior: the route map is derived from
// docs/index.yml and the link is resolved the way Fern serves it, both inside
// the checker under test (docs page reads happen there, not here).
