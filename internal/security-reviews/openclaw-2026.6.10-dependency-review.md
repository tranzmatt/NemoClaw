# OpenClaw 2026.6.10 Dependency Review

> Internal engineering evidence. This file is not part of the public documentation set.

Review date: 2026-07-03

Advisory audit revalidated: 2026-07-21

Retained remediation revalidated: 2026-08-21

WeChat locked-graph audit revalidated: 2026-07-12

Shields retirement addendum date: September 1, 2026.

Shields was retired from NemoClaw after this review was written. Every Shields reference below is retained as historical evidence of the snapshot, managed-extension, and ownership boundaries evaluated for the original OpenClaw 2026.6.10 integration; none describes a current command, supported runtime posture, or merge gate. The current mutable runtime retains the exact managed-extension inventory, peer-link validation, archive exclusion, and fail-closed snapshot restore guarantees recorded here without a Shields transition.

Scope: NemoClaw runtime pin `openclaw@2026.6.10`, the locked `mcporter@0.7.3` runtime graph, runtime helper pin `@zed-industries/codex-acp@0.11.1`, optional OpenClaw plugins, and built-in messaging OpenClaw plugins.

## Issue #5591 Acceptance Mapping

The integrity-pin regression is split by boundary: `test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-integrity-pin-base.test.ts` covers protected base provenance and archive filename confinement; `test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-integrity-pin-contract.test.ts` covers review-note and manifest pin alignment plus production build-argument ownership; and `test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-integrity-pin-plugin-install.test.ts` covers optional, core, and Codex ACP registry/download verification plus reviewed local-archive installation.

Issue #5591 is the dependency-update umbrella, and its proposed design has three literal clauses. "Latest stable version of Hermes" is satisfied by merged PR #5594 (`hermes-agent==2026.6.19`); "Latest version of OpenShell" is satisfied by merged PR #5596 (`openshell==0.0.71`); and "Latest stable version of OpenClaw" is the clause owned by this PR. For that OpenClaw clause, the repository pins the reviewed non-prerelease `openclaw@2026.6.10` artifact and its plugin SRIs, while the integrity-pin suites, `test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-dependency-review.test.ts`, and the E2E matrix for the PR SHA provide the acceptance evidence. This PR references rather than closes #5591 because the issue tracks the coordinated dependency set and release, not only the OpenClaw slice.

NemoClaw enforces the main `openclaw@2026.6.10`, `@zed-industries/codex-acp@0.11.1`, and each reviewed npm plugin registry integrity and reviewed registry tarball URL, including optional OTEL/brave plugins and messaging plugins, before install. `scripts/lib/reviewed-npm-archive.mts` is the shared implementation used by the Docker build boundaries and the messaging build applier. It queries registry metadata by exact package spec, packs only the reviewed tarball URL with `npm pack --json`, requires the downloaded tarball integrity to match the committed SRI, rejects reported archive filenames with unsafe archive paths—including values that are absolute, contain path separators, equal `.` or `..`, or resolve outside the fresh pack directory—or files that are missing or are not regular files, and returns only the verified local `.tgz` path. A production image may skip duplicate OpenClaw and locked-mcporter installation only when an official NemoClaw base carries the protected exact provenance marker described below.

## Upstream Release Boundary

The reviewed package is the non-prerelease [`v2026.6.10` GitHub release](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/tag/v2026.6.10), published at `2026-06-24T03:06:38Z` from release SHA `aa69b12d0086b631b139c1435c9621a5783e3a40`. The packaged changelog defines the release source boundary as `v2026.6.9..HEAD` and records 12 merged pull requests. The release primarily adds automatic fast mode and fixes model routing, session/channel state, trusted hook policy composition, and provider-plugin onboarding; none changes the reviewed Slack, Telegram, Teams, weather-skill, npm lifecycle, or compiled-dist patch interfaces described below. NemoClaw's compatibility claim is limited to the SRI-verified published artifacts and the checked-in regression/runtime proof; it does not cover later commits on upstream `main`.

## Advisory Check

Command run from the repository root with Node `v22.22.2` and the public npm registry:

```bash
NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmjs.org \
  node --experimental-strip-types scripts/audit-reviewed-npm-graph.mts
```

Revalidated on 2026-07-21: the command exited `0` under Node `v22.22.2`.
This runtime satisfies the OpenClaw engine requirement of `>=22.19.0`.
The remediated reviewed-archive graph reported `0` info, `1` low, `12` moderate, `0` high, and `0` critical findings across `767` total dependencies.
The mcporter locked graph reported no findings across `138` dependencies.
The locked mcporter graph overrides `@hono/node-server` to patched release `2.0.11` because `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.29.0` still requests a v1 range that contains no patched release for `GHSA-frvp-7c67-39w9`.
The configured `high` threshold therefore passed.

The retained low finding is `GHSA-v422-hmwv-36x6` in `body-parser@2.0.0` through `2.2.2`.
It remains in the reviewed Slack and Microsoft Teams plugin graphs.
The retained moderate root findings are `GHSA-frvp-7c67-39w9` in `@hono/node-server` before `2.0.5` and `GHSA-j3f2-48v5-ccww` in `protobufjs@7.5.0` through `7.6.4`.
The Hono finding remains in the reviewed OpenClaw graph, while the protobuf finding remains in the reviewed diagnostics OTEL and WhatsApp plugin graphs.
The audit reports their affected dependency chains as separate moderate entries.
These findings have upstream fixes, but applying them would change additional reviewed package shrinkwraps.
The current remediation does not silently extend its authority to those graphs.

This review is an advisory snapshot for the direct OpenClaw runtime package, the locked `mcporter@0.7.3` graph, Codex ACP runtime helper, optional plugins, messaging plugins, and their npm dependency graphs at review time. Default PR and main CI now rematerialize those exact direct packages from SRI-verified reviewed local archives under Node `22.23.1`, install with lifecycle scripts disabled, run `npm audit --registry=https://registry.yarnpkg.com --omit=dev --json` through `scripts/lib/reviewed-npm-audit.mts`, and upload both the raw reports and normalized policy results from `coverage/reviewed-npm-audit`. The configured threshold in `ci/reviewed-npm-audit.json` is `high`. Lower-severity findings remain visible without blocking. The same job independently installs and audits the committed mcporter production lock. This gate complements, but does not replace, the committed npm integrity pins, registry signature verification, and install-time archive checks.

The exception registry at `ci/npm-audit-exceptions.json` is empty by default. It is not a global npm-audit bypass: each entry must exactly match one advisory, audited graph, package, installed version, and reported severity. It must also record an expiring `not-affected` or `temporary-risk-acceptance` decision, rationale, owner, and NemoClaw issue or PR. Expiry is limited to 30 days. Temporary risk acceptance additionally requires compensating controls. Missing, malformed, expired, overlong, duplicate, mismatched, and unused entries fail the audit. The repository-wide audit also rejects exceptions for unknown graph IDs. The policy file hash, evaluation status, and accepted advisory IDs are bound into OpenClaw base-image provenance, so a child image cannot silently reuse a base built under a different exception set. The registry contains no exception for `GHSA-v2hh-gcrm-f6hx` or any other current advisory.

## Transitive Dependency Graph Rationale

The OpenClaw 2026.6.10 bump does not newly introduce an unfrozen OpenClaw transitive graph. The reviewed `openclaw@2026.6.10` artifact ships `npm-shrinkwrap.json`; the previous reviewed `openclaw@2026.6.9` artifact also shipped `npm-shrinkwrap.json`. A spot check of the reviewed 2026.6.10 package found lockfile version `3`, `306` package entries, and no resolved package entries missing integrity metadata. The reviewed `@openclaw/diagnostics-otel@2026.6.10`, `@openclaw/brave-plugin@2026.6.10`, `@openclaw/discord@2026.6.10`, `@openclaw/slack@2026.6.10`, `@openclaw/whatsapp@2026.6.10`, and `@openclaw/msteams@2026.6.10` artifacts also ship `npm-shrinkwrap.json`.

`@zed-industries/codex-acp@0.11.1` has no declared npm dependencies, so the committed package SRI plus reviewed tarball URL fully describes its npm install input for this release. At the time of this review, the only reviewed messaging plugin without a package-internal shrinkwrap was the existing non-OpenClaw Tencent WeChat plugin, `@tencent-weixin/openclaw-weixin@2.4.3`; the dependency bump accepted that transitive range risk while enforcing the top-level SRI and reviewed tarball URL. Current NemoClaw builds close that residual with a committed lock for the WeChat production graph. The image materializes the reviewed graph in a root-owned cache that the sandbox user cannot write, copies it into a disposable writable cache for the offline plugin install, verifies the installed managed graph against the committed lock, and removes the temporary cache in the same image layer.

### Transitive Remediation Boundary

This section is a point-in-time record of the remediation shipped for the
2026.6.10 runtime. The retained compatibility branch now replaces its affected
`tar` dependency with `7.5.21` after `GHSA-r292-9mhp-454m` affected releases
through `7.5.20`. The current 2026.7.1 path also remediates its source `tar` and
`fs-safe` graph, while retaining the version-scoped Slack and Microsoft Teams
Axios remediation and the diagnostics Jaeger remediation. See
[`openclaw-2026.7.1-dependency-review.md`](./openclaw-2026.7.1-dependency-review.md)
for the active source and validation boundary.

`scripts/lib/openclaw-npm-remediation.mts` recognizes only eight exact reviewed identities: the E2E-only 2026.3.11 core archive, four retained 2026.6.10 identities, and three active 2026.7.1 identities.
It rejects an unexpected source dependency shape before it changes or installs an archive.
The helper verifies every replacement package by exact registry SRI and tarball URL.
It also rejects unsafe archive members before extraction and after repacking.

For `openclaw@2026.6.10`, the helper makes these changes:

- Replaces `tar@7.5.16` with `tar@7.5.21`.
- Replaces `brace-expansion@5.0.6` with `brace-expansion@5.0.7`.
- Bundles the reviewed `@openclaw/fs-safe@0.3.0` package and removes its duplicate optional `tar` and `jszip` declarations. The bundled package resolves OpenClaw's reviewed direct `tar@7.5.21` and `jszip@3.10.1` dependencies instead, including during a global npm install.
- Verifies the installed global dependency tree before either the reviewed base image or production image can complete.

For the E2E-only `openclaw@2026.3.11` identity, the helper requires the exact `tar@7.5.11` declaration, no bundled dependencies, no bundled tar package, and no npm shrinkwrap.
The reviewed source archive SRI binds the remainder of the source manifest and package bytes.
The helper then verifies the exact `tar@7.5.21` registry SRI and tarball URL, copies that reviewed package into the remediated archive, and declares it as a bundled dependency so the later global install cannot resolve the replacement tar package from mutable registry state.
The committed patched-metadata hash binds the OpenClaw identity, replacement declaration, bundled-dependency marker, and bundled tar identity.

For `@openclaw/slack@2026.6.10` and `@openclaw/msteams@2026.6.10`, the helper makes these changes:

- Replaces bundled `axios@1.16.0` with `axios@1.18.0`.
- Adds the reviewed nested `https-proxy-agent@5.0.1` and `agent-base@6.0.2` graph required by that Axios release.

For `@openclaw/diagnostics-otel@2026.6.10`, the helper makes these changes:

- Replaces bundled `@opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger@2.8.0` with `2.9.0`, which returns safely for malformed percent-encoded Jaeger trace and baggage headers.
- Updates the bundled `@opentelemetry/sdk-node@0.219.0` dependency metadata to select the patched propagator.
- Nests reviewed `@opentelemetry/core@2.9.0` under the patched propagator so the remaining reviewed OpenTelemetry `2.8.0` graph keeps its exact dependency identities.

The OpenTelemetry migration review covers the complete published `v2.8.0..v2.9.0` range and requires upstream fix commit `b1c196d49d54caae59741cca0a9d57d101d7ea88` to be an ancestor of the `v2.9.0` tag.
The `v2.9.0` release was published on 2026-07-02 and records the malformed Jaeger-header fix.
Its unrelated breaking notice only deprecates the OpenTracing shim for a planned future major release.
The patched propagator and core packages support Node `^18.19.0 || >=20.6.0`, which includes NemoClaw's Node `22.19.0` floor.

The replacement packages are bound to these registry identities:

| Package | Reviewed npm integrity | Reviewed npm tarball URL |
|---|---|---|
| `tar@7.5.21` | `sha512-XdhtCvlMywwxpCW8YEq3lOXBJpUPTR2OHHcwLPO3HwsJqOHa2Ok/oJ7ruGzp+JrKoRPVCzJwAdEjqLW/vNRPHA==` | `https://registry.npmjs.org/tar/-/tar-7.5.21.tgz` |
| `brace-expansion@5.0.7` | `sha512-7oFy703dxfY3/NLxC1fh2SUCQ0H9rmAY+5EpDVfXjUTTs+HEwR2nYaqLv+GWcTsumwxPfiz6CzCNkwXwBUwqCA==` | `https://registry.npmjs.org/brace-expansion/-/brace-expansion-5.0.7.tgz` |
| `@openclaw/fs-safe@0.3.0` | `sha512-uIBE441CIt1kIURoP9qRGKZ8LkGyfD9ZzeESjwAd29ZPWtghws/5GR3Pjb67jKdcJHP1I6roNXcvnhzAU7lHlA==` | `https://registry.npmjs.org/@openclaw/fs-safe/-/fs-safe-0.3.0.tgz` |
| `axios@1.18.0` | `sha512-E32NzpYKp++W7XRe52rHiXV2ehxmh3wbdgO7MHeFM+vqxLBYHzt0ElkiImtOBxtOmyp0yoC8C6uESVV84Y2/hw==` | `https://registry.npmjs.org/axios/-/axios-1.18.0.tgz` |
| `https-proxy-agent@5.0.1` | `sha512-dFcAjpTQFgoLMzC2VwU+C/CbS7uRL0lWmxDITmqm7C+7F0Odmj6s9l6alZc6AELXhrnggM2CeWSXHGOdX2YtwA==` | `https://registry.npmjs.org/https-proxy-agent/-/https-proxy-agent-5.0.1.tgz` |
| `agent-base@6.0.2` | `sha512-RZNwNclF7+MS/8bDg70amg32dyeZGZxiDuQmZxKLAlQjr3jGyLx+4Kkk58UO7D2QdgFIQCovuSuZESne6RG6XQ==` | `https://registry.npmjs.org/agent-base/-/agent-base-6.0.2.tgz` |
| `@opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger@2.9.0` | `sha512-4mYGty27rYvSM0jtp1ZUOqd3LfVRCYg9H5G9OFzSx5HViYToU21MFhWfco7x1HwXr7ER8yGOiCIHZUwjPksc0Q==` | `https://registry.npmjs.org/@opentelemetry/propagator-jaeger/-/propagator-jaeger-2.9.0.tgz` |
| `@opentelemetry/core@2.9.0` | `sha512-m2nckMT80NnmjTYSPjJQObBJ+8dgkoajEOUbznL8AHZ3T3yHRk2P7gI1PhEBc1+lOnrYE9UWrWHqJDsmqjmNbw==` | `https://registry.npmjs.org/@opentelemetry/core/-/core-2.9.0.tgz` |

The helper extracts reviewed archives without invoking package lifecycle scripts and rebuilds them with `npm pack . --ignore-scripts --json`.
It binds each patched package manifest and shrinkwrap to a committed SHA-512 metadata value.
The core value also covers the bundled `@openclaw/fs-safe` package manifest.
The diagnostics value also covers the bundled SDK, Jaeger propagator, and nested core package manifests.
The expected values are `sha512-XMycUUV7gCzUYbjgwrglER0AQEtfuKUz6wyo4ilm/7nSSkLocYUYVkrJuBFYPW3no8Y5FW/1+2hWCssIyjxn3g==` for OpenClaw core, `sha512-ByLYBs3KXz3u0mPuj9DcP/xPTJNgQaLTPxazybhyIC1VjyftEmKQuoZufPZ8z8CjwBsOPm6NbjMQB2BfX36TTg==` for diagnostics OTEL, `sha512-AXllGzI+m33jUq3w1nCVXngLA1m9kH8c9XryHSoPzuVhGP6xwWpzgKl3yyfOMoIykN0GKcka59ZZbjEwkxFudQ==` for Slack, and `sha512-eTTIpA8HzcBwXBLt6UZDoFgOUmkRgIhcZFBOwg+5Jfgt8HDwtfPnqKo6vm2DdDdPMPhu08FbEzU5Gt3RoL5fIw==` for Microsoft Teams.
The E2E-only `openclaw@2026.3.11` value is `sha512-Yz/7GyAgLSPtJkijdUsVzxnjhATMPLRSFFMhl2H565aW7tReHZmuPeExBq0K4EEFkvg7zM2sFm2CP3f2oNw32Q==`.
Both the library and command-line entry points enforce the same committed values.
`Dockerfile.base` records `ignore-scripts+reviewed-lifecycle+transitive-remediation-v1` in its protected provenance marker.
The production Dockerfile rejects stale base provenance and repeats the remediation when the marker does not match.
Both image paths run a depth-bounded `npm ls` against the installed OpenClaw, `fs-safe`, `tar`, and `jszip` graph so a missing or invalid direct dependency fails during image assembly without traversing the unrelated global tree.
The messaging installer applies the same remediation before it installs the reviewed Slack or Microsoft Teams archive.
The reviewed npm audit applies that helper before installation, so Docker builds, messaging builds, and the advisory audit consume the same remediated archive shape.

### Transitive Remediation Concern Ledger

The following concerns record the failure mode, completed disposition, and remaining release gate for this remediation.

| ID | Surface and failure mode | Disposition and evidence | Remaining gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DEP-1` | The reviewed core archive resolves vulnerable `tar` and `brace-expansion` versions. A production image can retain the vulnerable graph. | The `migrate`, `guard`, and `test` dispositions replace exact source shapes with SRI-pinned versions, hash metadata, and reject drift in focused tests. | Full E2E must pass for the PR SHA. |
| `DEP-2` | The reviewed Slack and Microsoft Teams archives bundle the vulnerable Axios graph. Messaging plugin installs can retain that graph. | The `migrate`, `guard`, and `test` dispositions add Axios `1.18.0` and its pinned nested proxy graph before local archive installation. | Full E2E must pass for the PR SHA. |
| `DEP-3` | The diagnostics OTEL archive bundles a Jaeger propagator that throws for malformed percent-encoded trace or baggage headers. A remote header can terminate extraction through an unhandled exception. | The `migrate`, `guard`, and `test` dispositions replace Jaeger with `2.9.0`, isolate its exact `2.9.0` core dependency, bind the patched metadata, and reject upstream graph drift. | Full E2E and the reviewed npm audit must pass for the PR SHA. |
| `DEP-4` | `body-parser` retains one low root finding, while Hono and `protobufjs` retain moderate root findings. Expanding this patch to their package graphs without review can cause silent dependency drift. | The `document` disposition records each package, consumer, severity, and fix availability in the raw reports. The configured `high` threshold passes. | Re-review the affected package shrinkwraps before a later change remediates these findings. |
| `DEP-5` | A previously built base image can claim the unremediated install recipe. | The `guard` and `test` dispositions change the protected provenance recipe. A stale or mismatched marker takes the complete reviewed install path. | Base-image and production-image CI must pass for the PR SHA. |
| `DEP-6` | The replacement graph has no repository-generated lock-derived SBOM. The `https-proxy-agent@5.0.1` and `agent-base@6.0.2` tarballs declare MIT in package metadata but contain no license file. | The `document` disposition records reviewed registry metadata, SRI, tarball URL, declared license, and packaged license-file inventory. The other replacement tarballs include license files. `tar@7.5.21` declares BlueOak-1.0.0, the OpenTelemetry packages declare Apache-2.0, and the other packages declare MIT. | Maintainers must retain this notice and SBOM limitation or add generated attribution evidence before release policy requires it. |

## Slack Source Review

The main `openclaw@2026.6.10` package excludes `dist/extensions/slack/**`; its channel catalog points Slack installs to the external npm plugin `@openclaw/slack`. The reviewed `@openclaw/slack@2026.6.10` artifact exposes:

- `dist/runtime-api.js`, which exports `sendMessageSlack`;
- `dist/pipeline.runtime-*.js`, which exports `prepareSlackMessage`; and
- the denied channel-user gate containing `Blocked unauthorized slack sender ${senderId} (not in channel users)`, which NemoClaw's `slack-channel-guard` preload patches to emit one bounded sender-facing denial notice for explicit `app_mention` events.

The migrated Vitest lane in `test/e2e/live/messaging-providers.test.ts` calls `runInstalledSlackRuntimeProof` from `test/e2e/live/messaging-providers-slack-runtime-proof.ts`. That helper discovers the installed external `@openclaw/slack@2026.6.10` runtime and uses `prepareSlackMessage` from `dist/pipeline.runtime-*.js` plus `sendMessageSlack` from `dist/runtime-api.js`. The default 2026.6.10 live lane requires the resulting `openclaw-pipeline-runtime` proof and fails if only the older private helper is available. The private-helper branch is disabled unless an isolated legacy fixture explicitly sets `NEMOCLAW_E2E_ALLOW_LEGACY_SLACK_TEST_API=1`, and remains compatibility support pending retirement in #5896. The proof verifies an allowed channel `app_mention`, verifies a denied channel user receives exactly one bounded sender-facing feedback action, and sends against the hermetic fake Slack API with capture assertions that reject unresolved credential placeholders.

## Telegram Source Review

The main `openclaw@2026.6.10` package does not include `dist/extensions/telegram/test-api.js`. Its bundled Telegram channel still exposes `dist/extensions/telegram/runtime-api.js`, which exports `sendMessageTelegram` and accepts NemoClaw's hermetic fake Telegram API override for send proof.

The migrated Vitest lane calls `runInstalledTelegramRuntimeProof` from `test/e2e/live/messaging-providers-telegram-runtime-proof.ts`. That helper resolves the installed `openclaw/dist/extensions/telegram/runtime-api.js` file, fails closed unless `sendMessageTelegram` is exported, and sends through that runtime API against the host-side fake Telegram Bot API. `test/e2e/live/messaging-providers.test.ts` retains the OpenShell REST policy, token rewrite assertion, chat/text capture, and unresolved-placeholder checks around that installed-runtime call.

## Microsoft Teams Package-Load Review

The published `@openclaw/msteams@2026.6.10` artifact was re-reviewed after integrating the OpenShell 0.0.71 prerequisite. Its npm SRI is the committed `sha512-GjHnCPvjbnI0C7mEFcdT2uKDH4/WwOe2dZBfQiWxBtkE76m6TNG0J9dJjD4mc8/pk8rXSO0cWw+KV9jzWtF9VA==`; `package.json` declares `./dist/index.js` as its runtime extension; that entry has SHA-256 `2a83ee979d5ee9f12c7ac507ebd87024be3315de3f2cc87c81effc9ca85246d1`; and `dist/channel-plugin-api.js` has SHA-256 `2d451b31ba4fbcc0e22ea4654fdc55dc05ae680765b7d636bfbf89177eb1be4b`. `test/package-contract/msteams-message-hints-preload.test.ts` binds the preload compatibility fixture to that reviewed version, SRI, runtime entry, plugin specifier, and entry hashes. Both runtime-entry hashes are unchanged from the reviewed 2026.6.9 artifact. This is package/load-boundary evidence only; it does not claim live Bot Framework delivery.

## Bundled Weather Skill Egress Review

The SRI-verified `openclaw@2026.6.10` artifact's `package/skills/weather/SKILL.md` has SHA-256 `62ab4821aa873949d1c1091836be1659a42b32caadce4bd145f5505a1ceaeec1`, unchanged from the reviewed 2026.6.9 artifact. The reviewed skill prefers `web_fetch` to HTTPS `wttr.in` paths and lists HTTPS `wttr.in` curl fallbacks using read-only requests; it mentions `wttr.is` only as an optional retry when the primary service is unreliable. NemoClaw's weather preset therefore continues to allow only GET/HEAD to `wttr.in` at that boundary and intentionally leaves `wttr.is` denied unless a future pinned runtime makes the fallback required. `test/onboarding/effective-policy-contracts.test.ts` binds that host/method contract to the reviewed OpenClaw version.

## PR Review Follow-ups

### Installer Integrity Transaction Boundary

`Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.base`, optional OpenClaw plugin installs, and `src/lib/messaging/applier/build/messaging-build-applier.mts` bind reviewed npm installs to verified local archives through `scripts/lib/reviewed-npm-archive.mts`. The thin callers provide the exact package spec, committed SRI, reviewed tarball URL, and caller label. The helper verifies both `npm view` fields, packs the reviewed URL, validates the reported SRI and contained regular-file basename in a fresh directory, and returns the local archive before `npm install -g <local .tgz>` or `openclaw plugins install npm-pack:<local .tgz>` runs. Runtime mcporter uses the helper's metadata-only path before retaining its committed-lock `npm ci` transaction.

After `Dockerfile.base` completes the OpenClaw archive transaction and reviewed lifecycle, installs mcporter from the committed lock, checks both installed versions, and passes mcporter advisory and signature audits, it atomically publishes a root-owned, read-only provenance marker. The marker binds the OpenClaw package, SRI, tarball, and lifecycle recipe plus the mcporter package, SRI, tarball URL, lockfile SHA-256, audit exception-policy SHA-256, audit status, accepted advisory IDs, and audited-install recipe. The production Dockerfile may reuse both installs only for an official NemoClaw base reference (or the resolver's local base name) when the marker is a non-symlink regular file with exact `root:root` ownership, mode `0444`, byte-for-byte content, and both installed versions match. It removes the marker before applying NemoClaw patches so a derived image cannot claim pristine-base provenance. Missing, malformed, writable, symlinked, mismatched, custom-base, stale, or incomplete provenance takes the complete reviewed install fallback; a base newer than the reviewed OpenClaw target remains a hard failure.

Invalid state: `npm view` returns the reviewed SRI but the downloaded artifact used for install has different bytes; `npm pack --json` reports a filename such as `../package.tgz`, `/tmp/package.tgz`, or a name containing path separators so the later install consumes a path outside the fresh pack directory; or the production image reuses OpenClaw or mcporter without every provenance, metadata, trusted-base, lock-hash, and installed-version check above. Source boundary: Dockerfile npm install and provenance blocks, `Dockerfile.base`, the committed mcporter lock, optional plugin install blocks, and `src/lib/messaging/applier/build/messaging-build-applier.mts`. Source-fix constraint: npm package installation must stay artifact-bound for reviewed pins rather than reverting to a later floating package-spec transaction, and local archive path validation must be enforced at NemoClaw's install boundary because npm's JSON filename is untrusted input. Regression tests: the integrity-pin plugin-install suite exercises registry drift, reviewed tarball URL drift, downloaded archive verification, and reviewed local-archive installation; the integrity-pin base suite exercises unsafe reported archive filenames, exact OpenClaw/mcporter provenance reuse, fifteen fallback states, marker consumption, and newer-base rejection. `test/runtime/messaging/messaging-build-applier.test.ts` verifies messaging plugins run through `npm pack --json` and install the verified archive path; `test/runtime/messaging/messaging-build-applier-integrity.test.ts` verifies the messaging plugin install fails closed when packed archive integrity drifts or the reported archive filename escapes the pack directory. Removal condition: keep this archive verification and delegated-base provenance until the repo moves the OpenClaw/plugin dependency set to a lockfile path where npm enforces the committed SRI directly and no installer code consumes raw `npm pack --json` filenames.

#### Reviewed npm Lifecycle Boundary

Every reviewed archive install now suppresses npm lifecycle scripts.
The Codex ACP and OpenClaw core `npm install -g` transactions pass `--ignore-scripts`; optional and messaging plugin calls set both `NPM_CONFIG_IGNORE_SCRIPTS=true` and `npm_config_ignore_scripts=true` before invoking the SRI-reviewed OpenClaw plugin installer.
The first-party local `openclaw plugins install /opt/nemoclaw` boundary receives the same environment even though its source is the image's checked-in NemoClaw tree rather than a registry archive.
The reviewed `openclaw@2026.6.10` plugin installer also builds its internal npm command with `--ignore-scripts`, so the outer environment is a caller-owned fail-closed contract rather than the only protection.

`ci/reviewed-npm-lifecycle-allowlist.json` records the default-deny review policy and names every reviewed top-level registry archive identity accepted by these boundaries.
The Docker build contains matching closed version cases for the policy's only executable exceptions: the manifest-declared `node scripts/postinstall-bundled-plugins.mjs` for `openclaw@2026.6.10` and the retained SRI-pinned `openclaw@2026.4.24` stale-upgrade fixture.
After installing either core archive with scripts disabled, the Docker build invokes that one fixed installed path directly. The production fast path accepts only the base marker for this same reviewed lifecycle recipe and therefore does not invoke the lifecycle a second time.
The retained `openclaw@2026.3.11` fixture declares no install lifecycle and therefore receives no explicit invocation.
OpenClaw's warning-only `preinstall`, package `prepare`, and every dependency/plugin lifecycle remain suppressed.

The reviewed current graph contains three transitive install-hook families: `@google/genai@2.7.0` declares a no-op preinstall, `protobufjs@7.6.3` declares its package postinstall, and `tree-sitter-bash@0.25.1` declares `node-gyp-build`.
The WhatsApp plugin additionally contains Baileys' engine-requirement preinstall.
None is allowlisted.
For the native parser case, the reviewed `tree-sitter-bash@0.25.1` tarball already contains native prebuilds for both production architectures (`prebuilds/linux-x64/tree-sitter-bash.node` and `prebuilds/linux-arm64/tree-sitter-bash.node`), as well as Darwin and Windows prebuilds.
Isolated `node:22-trixie-slim` containers globally installed the reviewed OpenClaw archive with `--ignore-scripts`, ran the one explicit OpenClaw postinstall successfully, and loaded its nested `tree-sitter-bash` `bash` binding on both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` without creating a package build directory; an isolated direct check also passed on the local Darwin arm64 host.

Invalid state: any reviewed archive install can run package-controlled install hooks, a package other than an exact allowlisted OpenClaw version receives an explicit lifecycle invocation, or the allowed manifest command/path changes without review.
Source boundary: the five Docker install transactions, `installOpenClawMessagingPlugins`, and `ci/reviewed-npm-lifecycle-allowlist.json`.
Source-fix constraint: lifecycle suppression must remain caller-controlled even while OpenClaw's plugin installer independently applies the same policy; do not replace the fixed postinstall command with `npm rebuild`, `npm run` against an unverified package spec, or a blanket script enablement.
Regression tests: the integrity-pin base and plugin-install suites, `test/security/fetch-guard-patch-regression.test.ts`, and `test/runtime/messaging/messaging-build-applier.test.ts` exercise script suppression and the fixed postinstall command at the execution boundaries.
Removal condition: re-audit manifests, shrinkwrap `hasInstallScript` entries, and native prebuild coverage on every OpenClaw/plugin bump; remove an exception when the reviewed package no longer needs it, and never carry an exception to a new version implicitly.

#### Messaging Plugin Registry Provenance Boundary

`OPENCLAW_MESSAGING_PLUGIN_ARCHIVE_PROVENANCE_POLICY` is the machine-readable source of truth for registry provenance at the messaging plugin installer boundary.
It requires an exact npm package spec from a trusted built-in channel manifest, a committed SRI matching registry `dist.integrity`, a committed exact URL matching registry `dist.tarball`, and the same SRI in the `npm pack --json` result before local archive installation.
Its `registryTarballUrl` policy is `must-match-committed-url`; the trusted manifests carry exact tarball URLs for every messaging plugin installed by the reviewed OpenClaw 2026.6.10 image, including the unchanged Tencent WeChat plugin.

Invalid state: a serialized plan selects the package identity, a trusted manifest uses a non-exact npm spec or lacks its SRI or exact tarball URL, registry `dist.integrity` or `dist.tarball` differs from the committed evidence, `npm pack` reports different bytes, or the reported archive path escapes its fresh pack directory.
Source boundary: the trusted built-in channel manifests, `OPENCLAW_MESSAGING_PLUGIN_ARCHIVE_PROVENANCE_POLICY`, `reviewedOpenClawPluginIntegrityByPackageSpec`, `reviewedOpenClawPluginTarballUrlByPackageSpec`, `packVerifiedOpenClawPluginArchive`, and `scripts/lib/reviewed-npm-archive.mts`.
Source-fix constraint: keep package identity, SRI, and exact tarball URL authority in code-owned manifests; registry metadata is verification input and cannot replace the reviewed values.
Regression test: `test/runtime/messaging/messaging-build-applier-integrity.test.ts` executes the real applier with a fake registry, proves the expected URL permits `npm pack` and local archive installation, and proves a mismatched URL stops before either `npm pack` or `openclaw plugins install`.
Removal condition: retain these provenance checks in the shared installer and update the machine-readable policy, manifests, audit inventory, and behavioral regressions together whenever a reviewed plugin version changes.

#### Shared #5896 Archive and Audit Contract

The Codex ACP, runtime OpenClaw, base-image OpenClaw, optional-plugin, and messaging-plugin boundaries consume one reviewed implementation with thin shell or TypeScript callers. Every archive boundary retains exact reviewed package identity, registry SRI, reviewed registry tarball URL, packed-byte SRI, a nonempty regular-file basename contained in a fresh pack directory, install from the resolved local archive only, cleanup, and failure before install on any mismatch. Runtime OpenClaw either executes that full transaction or consumes the exact protected result of the base-image transaction under the bounded provenance checks above; it never substitutes a floating package-spec install. Runtime mcporter verifies the same exact registry metadata and then either installs and audits the committed lock or consumes the marker-bound result of that exact locked and audited base-image transaction.

Invalid state: a caller bypasses the helper, the audit inventory diverges from a production pin, CI audits a graph other than the verified local archives and committed mcporter lock, an exception is missing required review metadata or does not exactly match a current finding, base provenance uses a different exception policy, or audit evidence is lost when the threshold fails. Source boundary: `scripts/lib/reviewed-npm-archive.mts`, `scripts/lib/reviewed-npm-audit.mts`, the thin Docker and messaging callers, `ci/reviewed-npm-audit.json`, `ci/npm-audit-exceptions.json`, `scripts/audit-reviewed-npm-graph.mts`, and `.github/actions/ci-reviewed-npm-audit/action.yaml`. Source-fix constraint: #5242 retains general dependency-pin and canary design ownership; this slice records only the current production audit inventory and tests it against the caller-owned pins. Regression tests: the integrity-pin suites and `test/runtime/messaging/messaging-build-applier-integrity.test.ts` retain malicious filename, registry drift, packed-SRI drift, and local-install proof at each caller; `test/install/reviewed-npm-archive.test.ts` tests the shared archive primitive; and `test/automation/releases/reviewed-npm-audit.test.ts` pins the empty default, exact exception matching, expiry, threshold behavior, and fail-closed validation. Removal condition: keep the shared helpers and audit gate while reviewed npm archives remain production build inputs.

### OpenClaw Compiled-Dist Patch Runtime Boundary

The OpenClaw 2026.6.10 compiled-dist patches are localized compatibility patches for sandbox fetch routing, cron preflight proxying, `host.openshell.internal` web_fetch scoping, unconfigured strict-fetch managed-proxy activation, `chat.send`/`get-reply` correlation, bounded same-device approval, and #4434 TUI unreachable-inference diagnostics. The long-term source of truth for these behaviors remains upstream OpenClaw; NemoClaw's Dockerfile and patch scripts carry fail-closed version-shape patches only so the reviewed package can run inside the current NemoClaw/OpenShell sandbox contract.

Invalid state: a real installed `openclaw@2026.6.10` dist changes semantics while fixture-compatible recognizers still pass. Source boundary: the installed OpenClaw generated `dist` files, the Dockerfile fetch-guard patch block, `scripts/patch-openclaw-chat-send.mts`, `scripts/patch-openclaw-device-self-approval.mts`, and `scripts/patch-openclaw-issue-4434-diagnostics.mts`. Source-fix constraint: upstream OpenClaw should own permanent fixes; NemoClaw patches must stay version-scoped, fail closed on unknown shapes, and be removed when upstream ships reviewed behavior. Regression tests: `test/security/fetch-guard-patch-regression.test.ts`, `test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-chat-send-patch.test.ts`, `test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-device-self-approval-patch.test.ts`, and `test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-issue-4434-diagnostics-patch.test.ts` execute patched fixtures for the reviewed shapes. `test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-real-patched-dist-harness.test.ts` is the checked-in real-package harness: when run with `NEMOCLAW_REAL_OPENCLAW_DIST_HARNESS=1`, it downloads the reviewed tarball URL, verifies the committed SRI, extracts the actual `openclaw@2026.6.10` dist, applies the Dockerfile patch block, runs and audits all three focused patch scripts, and verifies Patch 2, Patch 2b, Patch 4, Patch 6, Patch 7, Patch 8, chat-send/get-reply/followup-runner markers, and the #4434 assistant-error formatter marker. For Patch 8 it also verifies the exact compiled session producer, dispatcher, device handler, canonical authz-resolver, and fixed-version journal linkage; invokes the exported real handler to deny shared-auth and cross-device requests and rotate the matching device token; retains successful concurrent-approval proof; and injects both one-sided publication directions plus a rejected rename to verify bounded rollback and fresh-process recovery without losing unrelated pending or paired/token entries.

The harness remains explicit opt-in for PR and local proof. Trusted main CI sets `NEMOCLAW_REAL_OPENCLAW_DIST_HARNESS=1` and materializes the reviewed archive automatically with a bounded download retry and a 12-minute job budget. PR CI intentionally does not treat PR-authored harness code as its own security gate.
This source-package proof is not a substitute for focused nightly E2E proof of affected runtime workflows, image builds for the PR SHA, or final full E2E proof before merge.
Removal condition: delete the localized patches and harness when OpenClaw ships the reviewed behavior; if NemoClaw keeps carrying the patches beyond this bump, retain both the archive harness and built-image runtime gates.

#### OpenClaw Patch Source-of-Truth Table

| Patch | Invalid state | Source boundary | Why upstream/source cannot be fixed here | Regression test | Removal condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Patch 2: `assertExplicitProxyAllowed` env-gated bypass | Proxy validation rejects the OpenShell-managed env proxy inside an `OPENSHELL_SANDBOX=1` sandbox, or the bypass applies outside that explicit sandbox boundary. | Reviewed `openclaw@2026.6.10` fetch-guard dist files containing `async function assertExplicitProxyAllowed`; NemoClaw Dockerfile only adds the sandbox env gate. | The validator is generated OpenClaw compiled dist from the npm package. This PR can only adapt the installed artifact for the NemoClaw/OpenShell sandbox contract; the durable behavior belongs upstream. | `test/security/fetch-guard-patch-regression.test.ts` executes the reviewed shape, verifies the env-gated bypass, and fails closed on unreviewed proxy-validator shapes. | Remove the patch when OpenClaw natively treats the OpenShell sandbox env proxy as allowed, or when NemoClaw no longer uses this env-proxy path. |
| Patch 2b: `host.openshell.internal` web_fetch trusted env-proxy policy | `host.openshell.internal` becomes reachable through strict fetch, through a broad `.internal` bypass, or without `useEnvProxy`; conversely, legitimate web_fetch traffic through the trusted env proxy is blocked. | Reviewed `fetchWithWebToolsNetworkGuard` and SSRF policy helpers in `openclaw@2026.6.10`; the Dockerfile patch adds exact `allowedHostnames` policy only for `useEnvProxy` and the exact host. | The host-gateway exception is a NemoClaw/OpenShell integration policy. Upstream OpenClaw owns generic web_fetch and SSRF semantics and should not receive a NemoClaw-specific hostname carveout without a broader design. | `test/security/fetch-guard-patch-regression.test.ts` covers trusted env-proxy host-gateway scoping, strict-mode blocking, and the reviewed `allowedHostnames` private-network boundary. | Remove the patch when OpenClaw exposes an upstream supported policy hook for this host-gateway use case or NemoClaw stops routing web_fetch through the OpenShell host gateway. |
| Patch 4: managed-proxy activation for `OPENSHELL_SANDBOX=1` | Unconfigured strict fetches in the sandbox bypass the OpenShell L7 proxy, or explicit dispatcher/direct policies are overwritten by the fallback. | Reviewed fetch-guard managed-proxy gate in `openclaw@2026.6.10`; the Dockerfile patch extends activation only when `OPENSHELL_SANDBOX=1` and no explicit `dispatcherPolicy` is present. | The compiled dist is package output. NemoClaw can keep sandbox egress compatible for this bump, but upstream OpenClaw should own a first-class managed-proxy behavior for sandboxed runtimes. | `test/security/fetch-guard-patch-regression.test.ts` asserts the unconfigured strict-fetch fallback while preserving explicit dispatcher policy behavior. | Remove the patch when OpenClaw routes sandbox strict fetches through the configured env proxy without NemoClaw mutation, or when sandbox egress no longer depends on that proxy. |
| Patch 6: cron model-provider preflight trusted env-proxy mode | Cron preflight resolves `inference.local` directly and fails with DNS/egress errors, or the rewrite widens multiple call sites without a reviewed shape. | Reviewed cron isolated-agent preflight call in `openclaw@2026.6.10` that uses `auditContext: "cron-model-provider-preflight"` with `fetchWithSsrFGuard` and `buildLocalProviderSsrFPolicy`. | The preflight call site lives in upstream OpenClaw source; NemoClaw only patches the reviewed compiled call site so scheduled runs can reach the OpenShell-managed inference route. | `test/security/fetch-guard-patch-regression.test.ts` guards the single-callsite shape, exact trusted-env-proxy insertion, and ambiguous multi-callsite failure mode. | Remove the patch when OpenClaw sets `mode: "trusted_env_proxy"` or equivalent env-proxy routing for managed inference preflight. |
| Patch 7: #4434 TUI unreachable-inference diagnostic enrichment | The TUI reports only `TypeError: fetch failed` or `LLM request timed out.` for blocked sandbox inference egress, or enrichment applies outside `OPENSHELL_SANDBOX=1`. | Reviewed assistant error formatter dist file containing `formatRawAssistantErrorForUi`; `scripts/patch-openclaw-issue-4434-diagnostics.mts` adds missing cause, gateway/upstream reporting, and recovery hint fields. | The formatter source lives in upstream OpenClaw. NemoClaw can patch the reviewed compiled artifact for the OpenShell sandbox contract, but the durable fix belongs upstream. | `test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-issue-4434-diagnostics-patch.test.ts` verifies both reviewed failure shapes, env gating, partial-field completion, full-message preservation, and fail-closed selectors; the #4434 live guards require all fields. | Remove the patch when OpenClaw emits HTTP/cause, gateway/upstream layer, and recovery hint directly for unreachable inference errors. |
| Patch 8: bounded same-device device scope approval | The CLI requests the scope it is trying to approve, never reaches `device.pair.approve`, loses concurrent requests/devices/tokens, or publishes only one half of the `pending.json` / `paired.json` transition and cannot converge after restart. | Reviewed 2026.6.10 devices CLI, session producer, canonical session-authz resolver, gateway dispatcher/device handler, and canonical `approveDevicePairing` pairing-state module; `scripts/patch-openclaw-device-self-approval.mts` changes exactly one selected CLI file, handler file, and pairing-state module. Host callers do not read or publish device state. | The handshake and pairing state machine are upstream OpenClaw behavior, but its reviewed `persistState(..., "both")` uses two independent writes without a cross-file recovery record. The version-scoped in-module patch routes only the exact signed CLI self-upgrade through the existing lock and a fixed-version journal; ordinary approval and bootstrap paths retain upstream `persistState`. | `test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-device-self-approval-patch.test.ts` covers exact-dist cardinality, caller and pending identity/role/scope denials, in-lock revalidation, and journal patch shape; `test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-real-patched-dist-harness.test.ts` validates the exact device-token session linkage, canonical token rotation, successful concurrent approvals, both one-sided crash directions, rejected-rename settlement, and fresh-process recovery while unrelated pending and paired/token entries survive. | Remove the patch only when OpenClaw both accepts the same complete operator-only self-upgrade through the gateway using the already-approved `operator.pairing` scope and publishes its pending/paired transition atomically or with equivalent durable restart recovery. |

### OpenClaw Diagnostics OTEL Host Gateway Boundary

The default `NEMOCLAW_OPENCLAW_OTEL_ENDPOINT=http://host.openshell.internal:4318` is scoped to the local OTLP traces collector and requires the dedicated `openclaw-diagnostics-otel-local` policy preset. That preset allows only `POST /v1/traces` and `POST /v1/traces/**` to `host.openshell.internal:4318` for the OpenClaw/node binaries, separate from the `web_fetch` host-gateway exception in Patch 2b.

The reviewed `@openclaw/diagnostics-otel@2026.6.10` package dist imports `OTLPTraceExporter` from `@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-proto`, resolves the configured OTLP endpoint, and contains no `web_fetch`, `fetchWithSsrFGuard`, or `withTrustedEnvProxy` references. That source boundary keeps diagnostics export traffic on the OpenTelemetry OTLP exporter path rather than NemoClaw's patched OpenClaw `web_fetch` helper. Removal condition: re-audit this boundary on the next diagnostics plugin bump or if the OTEL plugin starts routing exports through OpenClaw tool/web fetch APIs.

### Legacy Fixture Pins

The legacy `2026.3.11` and `2026.4.24` OpenClaw pins are retained only for stale-upgrade fixture builds. Production Dockerfile install blocks now reject those versions unless `NEMOCLAW_E2E_FIXTURE_LEGACY_OPENCLAW=1` is set explicitly. The E2E-scoped name is intentionally noisy so production build workflows do not treat it as a general override. Production image workflows run `scripts/check-production-build-args.sh` before production Docker builds so the fixture flag, both legacy version values, and every integrity/tarball Docker ARG declared by a production Dockerfile cannot be overridden through production build args or their corresponding environment variables. The guard also rejects future positional `*_INTEGRITY` and `*_TARBALL` names, keeping reviewed pin values repository-controlled even before the Dockerfile's registry and downloaded-archive checks run. The stale-upgrade E2E build contexts pass their fixture values only on fixture-specific build paths, and the integrity-pin contract suite verifies the default rejection, the explicit fixture opt-in, and the production workflow guard.

Frozen OpenShell gateway-upgrade fixtures select only the SRI-pinned OpenClaw `2026.4.24`, `2026.5.22`, `2026.5.27`, or `2026.6.10` archive.
The live test uses `packReviewedNpmArchive` to verify exact registry metadata, the reviewed tarball URL, and the downloaded SRI.
The adapter stores only that verified local archive at `nemoclaw/src/.nemoclaw-e2e-old-openclaw.tgz`, which the frozen optimized build-context staging preserves.
It installs the archive with lifecycle scripts disabled and invokes `postinstall-bundled-plugins.mjs` directly.
The `v0.0.74` and `v0.0.89` fixtures retain npm registry signature verification for their historical mcporter locks.
The reviewed `v0.0.36` and `v0.0.55` profiles require no advisory audit statement.
The reviewed `v0.0.74` and `v0.0.89` profiles require exactly one advisory audit statement, which the adapter replaces with a test-only skip.
Each audit policy is bound to one exact reviewed NemoClaw tag, full commit SHA, and OpenClaw version tuple before the installer is patched.
The adapter rejects an unknown or mixed tuple and any advisory audit count that does not match its reviewed profile.
`test/e2e/support/openshell-gateway-upgrade-old-installer.test.ts` verifies these constraints.

Invalid state: a production image build overriding `OPENCLAW_VERSION` to an old fixture pin or replacing any repository-reviewed integrity/tarball value while still passing the workflow boundary. Source boundary: Dockerfile and Dockerfile.base install blocks plus the guard that precedes every production image build. Source-fix constraint: keep stale-upgrade E2Es able to build old images without normalizing those pins or accepting caller-controlled production package identity. Regression tests: the integrity-pin contract suite rejects the flag, both legacy versions, all declared integrity/tarball ARG overrides through direct, `--build-arg`, and environment paths, and a future-shaped positional pin name; `test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-dependency-review.test.ts` proves all seven production image builds are guard-protected and carry no literal fixture selectors. Removal condition: issue #5896 section 9 retires the old-base fixture strategy and fixture flag; the general repository-owned production pin guard remains until production builds no longer expose package identity as Docker ARGs.

### OpenClaw Device Approval Convergence Boundary

The pinned OpenClaw 2026.6.10 devices CLI normally requests the scopes it is trying to approve. For a complete same-device repair, Patch 8 selects `operator.pairing` transport; however, merely unsetting the gateway environment triplet still lets OpenClaw reload `gateway.auth.token` from `openclaw.json`. The approval then authenticates as shared-token rather than device-token, so the strict handler cannot establish the signed same-device identity and the canonical writer correctly rejects the requested write upgrade as missing `operator.read`. Patch 8 therefore forces OpenClaw's existing local-only stored-device-auth path only for the exact complete bounded self-repair classification and requires that stored token to grant `operator.pairing`; explicit URL/auth overrides and remote mode continue to fail closed in OpenClaw's call boundary. If that exact stored-device approval fails, the CLI returns the failure without retrying through configured shared/admin credentials or its local approval fallback. The gateway then requires device-token authentication, a signed device ID and public key matching the pending request, exact `role=operator`, `clientId=cli`, `clientMode=cli`, an operator-only pending role, a complete scope list, and caller scopes containing only pairing/read/write. The canonical `approveDevicePairing` function repeats current pending identity, role, repair-marker, and bounded-scope validation after acquiring its existing module lock; only then can the effective authorization expand to the request's canonical subset of pairing/read/write. OpenClaw remains responsible for reloading state, rotating the operator token, broadcasting resolution, and responding. Ordinary admin approval and bootstrap flows continue through upstream `persistState`; only the exact bounded self-approval branch uses the in-module recoverable publication path.

At the host-caller boundary, NemoClaw no longer reads or writes device state during approval. Inside the reviewed compiled pairing module, Patch 8 writes a fixed-version, exact-schema `idle` / `prepared` / `committed` journal beside the pairing files with mode `0600` and a `0700` directory contract. Before publication it records the exact before/after snapshots and request/device identity in `prepared`; because those snapshots can contain device tokens, the journal is never logged, remains permission-bounded, and drops all snapshots when it returns to `idle`. The module waits for both canonical pending and paired writes with `Promise.allSettled`, records `committed` only after both succeed, and finally returns the journal to `idle`. Recovery runs from pairing-state loads under the module lock, rejects a malformed journal or any current file that is neither its exact before-image nor after-image, restores `prepared` transactions backward, completes `committed` transactions forward, and returns to `idle`, so a fresh process deterministically settles either one-sided publication direction. A synchronous publication failure uses the same prepared recovery before the approval error is returned.

`scripts/lib/openclaw_device_approval_policy.py` remains a pure allowlist/environment helper that requires the explicit `cli`, `openclaw-cli`, or `openclaw-control-ui` client identity and never accepts an unknown identity merely for claiming `cli` or `webchat` mode; the startup, interactive-shell, and connect-time callers count only an OpenClaw CLI exit status of zero. Invalid state: any caller without device-token auth, signed same-device identity, exact CLI/operator metadata, existing `operator.pairing`, or complete bounded non-admin scopes receives the self-approval exception; current pending state is not revalidated inside the pairing lock; a host caller reads or publishes `pending.json` / `paired.json`; a failed CLI result is counted as approved; concurrent canonical approvals lose an unrelated pending request or paired token; or an interrupted two-file publication cannot recover to the journal's exact before/after state. Source boundary: the reviewed OpenClaw CLI, session producer, canonical session-authz resolver, gateway dispatcher/device handler, pairing-state dist module and its fixed-version journal, the pure policy module, and the three host callers. Source-fix constraint: OpenClaw owns pairing state; keeping recovery inside its reviewed compiled module and existing lock is safer than a host-side writer, while native atomic/recoverable publication belongs upstream. Regression detection: `test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-device-self-approval-patch.test.ts`, `test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-device-approval-policy.test.ts`, `test/agents/openclaw/runtime/nemoclaw-start-scope-replacement.test.ts`, connect-time auto-pair tests, the exact-dist linkage/real-handler/concurrent-publication/restart-recovery proof, and the issue #4462/device-auth live lanes. Removal condition: delete Patch 8 when a reviewed OpenClaw release completes this bounded same-device flow natively, but only if that release also publishes the pending/paired transition atomically or with equivalent durable restart recovery; retain the no-admin live assertion and behavioral proof that host callers leave device state untouched.

### Recovered Gateway Credential Boundary

During rebuild, OpenShell remains the system of record for provider credential bytes.
NemoClaw does not read, export, or replace a credential that exists only in the gateway.
Except for the bounded compatible-endpoint bridge rewrite described below, recovery does not update or repoint the registered provider.
NemoClaw accepts provider, model, preferred API, and custom endpoint metadata only as one complete route from either the current registry row or the matching onboard session; a partial registry row is never completed from older session data.
The recovery path may omit direct host validation only when the selection was recovered from the target sandbox, provider/model values are complete and bounded, the preferred API is compatible with that provider type, and `openshell provider get` reports the exact provider name, type, credential-binding key, and expected endpoint-config key. Its display parser accepts OpenShell's ANSI-styled field labels but rejects escape or control bytes inside semantic values before applying the ASCII identifier and binding-key allowlists.
Custom-endpoint reuse additionally requires the complete route to come from the current registry row, to canonicalize to the same recorded HTTP(S) identity, and every other registry entry using that global provider to record that same endpoint.
Before destructive rebuild deletes the sandbox and registry row, NemoClaw captures a complete bounded route directly from that row and, when no host key exists, requires the same provider/model/API/endpoint and non-secret gateway bindings to pass the credential-reuse assessment before backup or deletion. It defensively copies and freezes the route behind a runtime `source: "registry"` check, then passes that route only in memory to the same sandbox's recreate provider-selection call via the immutable handoff; the persisted resume session carries only the ordinary route fields, never the handoff or its provenance marker. Session-only and explicit-environment endpoints never receive registry provenance, and the normal image/registry cleanup happens immediately. This preserves the registry-backed trust boundary without a phantom registry entry or persisted spoofable marker.

OpenShell deliberately reports provider config keys but not config values, so NemoClaw cannot confirm the exact live endpoint value through this interface.
Recovery does not run `provider update` except for the bounded compatible-endpoint bridge rewrite.
After the existing non-secret provider-shape and binding authorization succeeds, an exact HTTP loopback endpoint on a bundled local-inference port receives a config-only update that replaces the loopback authority with `host.openshell.internal` while preserving the URL suffix.
The update passes no `--credential` flag or credential value.
All other recovered providers preserve the gateway's existing credential/config binding unchanged and re-apply only `inference set` for the recovered provider/model.
Outside this explicit rewrite, an existing provider may already have been redirected out of band; that endpoint-value drift is the residual this interface cannot detect, while the recovery path cannot introduce or change that redirection.

Invalid state: a rebuild with no host key probes a remote endpoint with an empty credential and fails after deleting the old sandbox, mixes partial current metadata with stale session fields, silently reuses a gateway provider for an explicit, malformed, provider-incompatible, or conflicting-endpoint selection, or applies the bridge rewrite without an exact loopback authority, bundled port, and authorized provider binding.
Source boundary: `src/lib/actions/sandbox/rebuild-provider-preflight.ts`, `src/lib/onboard/provider-recovery.ts`, `src/lib/onboard/recovered-provider-reuse.ts`, `src/lib/onboard/inference-providers/compatible-endpoint-gateway-route.ts`, `src/lib/onboard/inference-providers/remote.ts`, `src/lib/onboard.ts`, and OpenShell's provider registry.
Source-fix constraint: OpenShell intentionally does not expose stored credential or config values, so NemoClaw can reconcile only non-secret routing metadata and must fail closed if the exact provider shape or one complete recovery identity is unavailable.
Regression tests: `src/lib/actions/sandbox/rebuild-provider-preflight.test.ts` rejects incomplete, unbounded, spoofed, unauthenticated Bedrock, and conflicting keyless recovery before destructive work; `src/lib/onboard/provider-recovery.test.ts` rejects partial or unbounded live CLI output and mixed-source routes; `src/lib/onboard/gateway-provider-metadata.test.ts` rejects control-sequence, null-byte, and Unicode-homograph identities; `src/lib/onboard/rebuild-route-handoff.test.ts` proves defensive immutability and registry-only provenance; `src/lib/onboard/recovered-provider-reuse.test.ts` covers provider/API/endpoint compatibility and fail-closed cases; `src/lib/onboard/inference-providers/compatible-endpoint-gateway-route.test.ts` constrains bridge rewrites to exact loopback authorities and bundled ports; `test/onboarding/onboard-inference-gateway-scope.test.ts` proves the recovery update is config-only and receives no credential; `test/onboarding/onboard-remote-recreate-credential-reuse.test.ts` proves other remote routes are re-applied without a provider update, credential flag, config replacement, or direct curl probe.
The `hermes-discord` and `channels-add-remove` live jobs remain the real rebuild gates.
Removal condition: replace this localized decision boundary when OpenShell provides a typed credential-preserving provider/route reconcile operation that validates through its stored credential without disclosing it.

### Image-Managed OpenClaw Extension Restore Boundary

Fresh OpenClaw images own the executable copies of reviewed archive-installed extensions.
Snapshot restore may restore user extensions, but it excludes every image-managed extension directory and preserves those directories during cleanup.
Snapshot symlink validation permits only these extension link shapes:

- The exact `extensions/<id>/node_modules/openclaw` peer link to `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/openclaw`.
- The reviewed WeChat `qrcode-terminal` executable link with its exact target.
- Extension-local npm `.bin` links whose relative targets remain inside the same `node_modules` tree.

Before cleanup, NemoClaw rejects any managed extension path that is not a real directory, including a dangling symlink.
The snapshot policy lives in `src/lib/state/openclaw-managed-extensions.ts`.
At the time of the original review, the now-retired descriptor-safe Shields transition in `scripts/state-dir-guard.py` mirrored only the exact OpenClaw peer-link source shape and target above, read the link itself without following the external target, and otherwise retained the generic fail-closed symlink policy.
At that time, `src/lib/state/sandbox.ts` only orchestrated those policies during validation and restore.

Invalid state: archived executable plugin copies overwrite freshly rebuilt reviewed extensions, cleanup deletes a managed extension, or a broader symlink allowance permits a link outside the exact reviewed boundaries. The historical Shields-specific invalid state was that the then-supported transition could reject or remove the reviewed peer link and leave rollback incomplete.
Historical source boundary: `src/lib/state/openclaw-managed-extensions.ts`, the now-deleted `scripts/state-dir-guard.py`, NemoClaw snapshot validation/restore, and the reviewed OpenClaw image extension layout.
Historical source-fix constraint: upstream OpenClaw did not own NemoClaw snapshot archives or the now-retired Shields transition. The current local snapshot boundary still enforces image ownership without following an external symlink target.
Historical regression evidence included the now-deleted `test/state/state-dir-guard.test.ts`, which proved that preflight, lock, and unlock preserved only the exact peer link while rejecting wrong targets, source shapes, extension IDs, non-OpenClaw roots, and descriptor-observed cross-device traversal, and preserved extended attributes across fresh-inode transitions. Current coverage in `src/lib/state/openclaw-managed-extensions.test.ts`, `test/state/snapshot.test.ts`, and `test/security/security-sandbox-tar-traversal.test.ts` retains the managed-set, restore-exclusion, integration, and traversal guarantees; the `messaging-providers` live rebuild requires explicit complete post-restore success without a critical rollback warning.
The historical helper's removal condition was satisfied when the Shields transition was retired. The current managed-extension snapshot policy remains until snapshot metadata records extension ownership structurally and the generic restore engine can exclude image-owned paths without an OpenClaw-specific policy.

### Slack Inbound `app_mention`

The external `@openclaw/slack@2026.6.10` package no longer needs to be treated as package-shape-only evidence. `test/e2e/live/messaging-providers-slack-runtime-proof.ts` discovers the installed external runtime files, imports the hashed pipeline runtime for `prepareSlackMessage`, imports the runtime API for `sendMessageSlack`, and only reports `openclaw-pipeline-runtime` after allowed prepare, denied prepare, bounded denied-user feedback, and fake Slack send evidence all pass. `test/e2e/live/messaging-providers.test.ts` additionally requires the captured `chat.postMessage` metadata to prove the expected channel and text, a successful host-token rewrite, and no unresolved placeholder without recording the raw token.

Invalid state: claiming `openclaw-pipeline-runtime` inbound proof without both checked-in import logic and fake Slack capture evidence. Current source boundary: `test/e2e/live/messaging-providers.test.ts`, `test/e2e/live/messaging-providers-slack-runtime-proof.ts`, and `test/e2e/lib/fake-slack-api.cjs`. Source-fix constraint: send-only `runtime-api.js` coverage is not enough for inbound authorization coverage. Regression detection: `test/e2e/support/messaging-providers-runtime-proofs.test.ts` syntax-checks the sandbox module and pins its installed-export, denied-prepare, single-feedback, and fake-send markers; the `messaging-providers` live job is the behavioral gate against the installed package. The retired `test/e2e/test-messaging-providers.sh` entrypoint and `test/e2e/lib/slack-api-proof.sh` remain historical implementation context only. The E2E matrix for the last pre-migration commit remains historical runtime evidence; the migrated proof becomes fresh runtime evidence only when the post-merge `messaging-providers` job passes for the migration commit.

### Telegram Runtime Send

The bundled OpenClaw Telegram channel proof must use the current `dist/extensions/telegram/runtime-api.js` surface. `test/e2e/live/messaging-providers-telegram-runtime-proof.ts` fails closed if the installed runtime file is missing or if it stops exporting `sendMessageTelegram`, because falling back to the removed private `test-api.js` facade would make the 2026.6.10 package-shape proof stale.

Invalid state: a passing fake Telegram proof that imports `dist/extensions/telegram/test-api.js` or bypasses OpenClaw's installed runtime send helper. Current source boundary: `test/e2e/live/messaging-providers.test.ts`, `test/e2e/live/messaging-providers-telegram-runtime-proof.ts`, and `test/e2e/lib/fake-telegram-api.cjs`. Source-fix constraint: keep the host-side fake Telegram API, request-body credential rewrite policy, token rewrite assertion, chat/text capture, and placeholder-leak checks intact. Regression detection: `test/e2e/support/messaging-providers-runtime-proofs.test.ts` syntax-checks the sandbox module and pins `runtime-api.js`, `sendMessageTelegram`, and the fake-send boundary; the `messaging-providers` live job is the installed-runtime behavioral gate. The retired `test/e2e/test-messaging-providers.sh` entrypoint and `test/e2e/lib/telegram-api-proof.sh` remain historical implementation context only. The E2E matrix for the last pre-migration commit remains historical runtime evidence; the migrated proof becomes fresh runtime evidence only when the post-merge `messaging-providers` job passes for the migration commit.

### Issue #4434 TUI Unreachable Inference

The #4434 migrated live guard in this version-bump PR is a full live acceptance guard for the reviewed NemoClaw/OpenShell runtime boundary. NemoClaw now applies `scripts/patch-openclaw-issue-4434-diagnostics.mts` after installing `openclaw@2026.6.10`; the script patches the reviewed `formatRawAssistantErrorForUi` dist shape to enrich sandbox-only `fetch failed` and `LLM request timed out.` TUI errors with:

- `Cause: fetch failed while reaching the upstream API.` or `Cause: timed out while reaching the upstream API.`
- `Reporting layer: gateway proxy / upstream API.`
- `Recovery hint: check sandbox egress and provider reachability, then retry.`

The enrichment is gated by `process.env.OPENSHELL_SANDBOX === "1"` and only matches the reviewed `fetch failed` or `LLM request timed out.` shapes. Non-sandbox OpenClaw output keeps upstream behavior, and already structured upstream output is preserved or completed without duplicating fields. The unpatched upstream `openclaw@2026.6.10` #4434 output remains accepted only as the source-level removal trigger: `test/e2e-runtime/issue-4434-error-fields.test.ts` verifies that the upstream-shaped timeout output is missing all three required acceptance fields while the NemoClaw-patched runtime output has all three. The migrated `test/e2e/live/issue-4434-tui-unreachable-inference.test.ts` guard fails unless the captured TUI output includes an HTTP status or cause, a gateway/upstream reporting layer, a recovery hint, a visible error, a recognizable final status line, and final `| error` status inside the default 180-second timeout.

Invalid state: the TUI returns to the spinner-plus-connected signature, the structured fields are missing from the captured live output, or the formatter patch applies outside the OpenShell sandbox boundary. Source boundary: OpenClaw TUI/chat error output captured by the #4434 live guard plus the reviewed assistant error formatter dist file patched by `scripts/patch-openclaw-issue-4434-diagnostics.mts`. Source-fix constraint: the durable source fix belongs upstream OpenClaw; this PR carries a fail-closed compiled-dist shim so the reviewed package satisfies the NemoClaw/OpenShell runtime acceptance contract now. Regression detection: `test/e2e-runtime/issue-4434-error-fields.test.ts` classifies the reviewed patched output and rejects the old partial output; `test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-issue-4434-diagnostics-patch.test.ts` verifies the patch behavior and selectors. Removal condition: remove the patch script and keep the full live assertions when upstream OpenClaw emits equivalent HTTP/cause, gateway/upstream layer attribution, and recovery hint fields directly.

Merge disposition for this OpenClaw 2026.6.10 bump: #4434 TUI unreachable-inference acceptance is code-backed for the reviewed `openclaw@2026.6.10` artifact via a NemoClaw compatibility shim. Release notes or merge context should describe that boundary precisely: this PR closes the NemoClaw runtime acceptance gap, while upstream OpenClaw still owns the permanent source-level diagnostic behavior.

### Microsoft Teams Live E2E Disposition

The Teams manifest is intentionally documented as experimental channel support. Full Teams onboarding and message round-trip proof requires a real Microsoft tenant, Bot Framework app credentials, an app password, allowed user object IDs, and a public HTTPS webhook that forwards to the sandbox `/api/messages` endpoint. Those prerequisites cannot run in default PR CI without tenant-owned secrets and public ingress.

No real Microsoft Teams tenant proof is included in this PR. The work remains tracked as a follow-up outside this dependency bump: provision tenant-owned credentials and ingress, originate an authenticated Bot Framework activity from the tenant, observe the sandbox reply in Teams, and retain sanitized evidence. Until that proof exists, manifest rendering, package-integrity checks, local port-forward tests, or replaying a captured activity must not be described as a Teams round trip or counted as Teams runtime proof.

### Release Checklist for Accepted Residual Risk

- [x] OpenClaw real patched-dist harness: main CI runs it automatically from trusted merged code, while `NEMOCLAW_REAL_OPENCLAW_DIST_HARNESS=1 npx vitest run --project integration test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-real-patched-dist-harness.test.ts` remains the explicit PR/local proof. It is intentionally not a PR check because PR-authored harness code cannot serve as its own trusted security gate.
  It materializes the reviewed tarball, verifies SRI, applies the Dockerfile patch block, and audits chat-send/get-reply/followup-runner markers.
  Before merge, keep CI image builds for the PR SHA plus focused/full E2E workflow proof as the runtime evidence boundary.
- [x] Issue #4434 full live acceptance: `scripts/patch-openclaw-issue-4434-diagnostics.mts` enriches the reviewed OpenClaw formatter for sandbox-only `fetch failed` and `LLM request timed out.` errors, and the migrated `test/e2e/live/issue-4434-tui-unreachable-inference.test.ts` guard requires HTTP/cause, gateway/upstream layer attribution, and a recovery hint.
- [x] Future #4434 upstream-removal trigger: on the next relevant OpenClaw bump, rerun `test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-issue-4434-diagnostics-patch.test.ts` and the real patched-dist harness. If upstream emits equivalent fields directly, remove the shim while preserving full live assertions.

### Advisor Disposition

- The #4434 compatibility-shim disposition is explicitly accepted for this OpenClaw 2026.6.10 PR only: `test/e2e-runtime/issue-4434-error-fields.test.ts` verifies 3/3 fields are present in the NemoClaw-patched runtime output and 3/3 fields are missing in the upstream-shaped `openclaw@2026.6.10` output. On the next OpenClaw bump that emits equivalent fields upstream, remove `scripts/patch-openclaw-issue-4434-diagnostics.mts` in the same change and keep the full live assertions.
- The assembled-image and rebuilt-sandbox proof residual is explicitly accepted for this OpenClaw 2026.6.10 dependency bump only. The checked-in real-distribution harness binds the SRI-verified package to every reviewed patch and audit marker; production image workflows run the build-argument guard before assembling the final images; `network-policy` exercises the resulting OpenShell policy; and `messaging-providers`, `hermes-discord`, `channels-add-remove`, and both `channels-stop-start` variants exercise rebuilt sandboxes, installed messaging runtimes, and keyless registered-provider reuse without credential replacement. No single lane combines the final production image, a live `host.openshell.internal` SSRF-negative matrix, and every keyless custom-provider rebuild, so a cross-boundary packaging or wiring regression remains possible even though each boundary fails closed independently. Do not describe this as one combined end-to-end proof. Remove this acceptance when the canonical E2E matrix gains that assembled-image cross-product, or re-evaluate it on the next OpenClaw bump before retaining the same split proof.
- The literal issue #2478 Local Ollama plus Telegram inbound recovery residual is explicitly accepted for this OpenClaw 2026.6.10 dependency bump only.
  `issue-2478-crash-loop-recovery` identity-checks and terminates one live gateway process before invoking the production `connect --probe-only` path, exercising PID 1's exit-driven respawn behavior.
  The production command reports recovery and the test verifies that the terminated gateway process identity is replaced.
  The test uses a hermetic compatible endpoint to verify guard-chain restoration, `inference.local` availability, and a recovered process identity that remains unchanged for 15 seconds.
  `test/agents/openclaw/runtime/nemoclaw-start-guard-recovery.test.ts` runs the extracted production restoration helper five times against the same runtime state.
  The deterministic test verifies identical restoration steps, fixed proxy environment content, read-only file modes, and one restoration warning.
  `messaging-providers` imports the installed Telegram `runtime-api.js`, sends through `sendMessageTelegram`, and verifies token rewrite plus fake Bot API capture.
  This does not reproduce `nemotron-3-super:120b` on Local Ollama or originate a Telegram inbound update after the crash.
  The tests therefore do not prove agent-runtime and messaging-channel inbound restart behavior.
  Do not claim the literal deployment scenario from these split tests.
  Remove this acceptance when a stable CI fixture drives a Telegram inbound update through the recovered Local Ollama sandbox.
  Otherwise, re-evaluate the residual on the next OpenClaw bump.
- The transitive remediation closes the reviewed high-severity `tar`, `brace-expansion`, Axios, and Jaeger propagator findings without changing the OpenClaw version.
  The exact source shapes, replacement SRIs, tarball URLs, patched metadata, and provenance recipe fail closed on drift.
  The low `body-parser` and moderate Hono and `protobufjs` findings remain documented at the configured `high` threshold.
  Current NemoClaw closes the WeChat residual with `agents/openclaw/wechat-runtime/package-lock.json` and post-install graph verification.
- `src/lib/messaging/channels/manifests.test.ts` remains below the shared `test-size:check` threshold and does not need extraction in this dependency bump.
- The npm audit result in this note remains a point-in-time snapshot.
  Default PR and main CI rematerialize the production-compatible graph from the reviewed local archives, audit it and the committed mcporter lock with `npm audit --registry=https://registry.yarnpkg.com --omit=dev --json` through the reviewed evaluator, upload the raw reports and normalized policy results, and fail on unaccepted findings at the configured `high` threshold.
  The separate `wechat-runtime-audit` gate uses Node `22.19.0` and npm `10.9.4`, installs the committed WeChat production lock with scripts disabled, fails on any low-or-higher production advisory, verifies registry signatures, exercises the reviewed archive through a copied writable cache, and uploads its evidence.
  Pull requests execute that WeChat audit action from the PR base SHA.
  If the PR base SHA does not contain the action, the pull request workflow fails.
  The production installer routes registry metadata lookup, archive packing, and installation through the disposable writable-cache boundary so retrieval cannot fall back to `HOME/.npm`; the trusted source cache remains read-only and the disposable copy is removed in the same image layer.

- The stale nonterminal rebuild-resume repair in `src/lib/actions/sandbox/rebuild-resume-session.ts` remains a migration compatibility shim tracked against #4533's onboard FSM/resume compatibility boundary. Its removal condition is to delete it after a session-version migration proves recreate sessions are always persisted at a resumable pre-sandbox boundary; `src/lib/actions/sandbox/rebuild-resume-session.test.ts` covers the helper directly, `test/onboarding/onboard-resume-provider-recovery.test.ts` carries the onboard-suite producer-level regression for `machine.state='openclaw'`, and `src/lib/actions/sandbox/rebuild-resume-snapshot.test.ts` owns the rebuild handoff regression.
- Production OpenClaw image build paths call `scripts/check-production-build-args.sh` before production `docker build` or `docker/build-push-action` use. `test/agents/openclaw/openclaw-dependency-review.test.ts` keeps that workflow contract documented.
- The rebuild-reasoning cases added by this PR live in the focused `rebuild-resume-reasoning.test.ts` file; the smaller route-provenance additions remain with their `rebuild-resume-config.ts` boundary tests.
- `src/lib/state/sandbox.ts` is 100 lines smaller than current `main` in this PR. Managed-extension policy, restore exclusions, symlink predicates, and cleanup construction now live in `openclaw-managed-extensions.ts`; further decomposition of unrelated snapshot orchestration is outside this dependency bump.
- Issue #5896 section 2 archive consolidation is implemented by `scripts/lib/reviewed-npm-archive.mts`; Codex ACP, OpenClaw core, base-image, optional-plugin, and messaging installation boundaries retain caller-specific behavior tests around the shared implementation.
- Legacy Slack fixture retirement and broader setup/test refactors also remain deferred to #5896. The default 2026.6.10 lane cannot use the legacy helper; only an explicitly flagged isolated fixture can reach it.
- `isAllowedStateSymlink` has direct source- and target-traversal vectors in `openclaw-managed-extensions.test.ts`, in addition to the snapshot/tar traversal integration suites.
- Live gateway display output is treated as untrusted text: `gateway-provider-metadata.ts` bounds the complete output and each field, strips terminal decoration, requires one complete syntax-safe schema with unique environment-style binding keys, and returns only the exact requested provider. Recovery then requires exactly one expected credential key and endpoint-config key. Partial, oversized, duplicated, malformed, or ambiguous output fails closed in focused parser tests.
- Retained older OpenClaw pins are inactive compatibility/rollback branches, not the production default. Before every production image build, the production guard rejects the fixture flag, both legacy version values, every declared integrity/tarball ARG override from positional or environment input, and future-shaped positional pin names; the Dockerfile then fails closed unless the selected version has its repository-owned SRI and reviewed tarball URL. Issue #5896 section 9 retires the fixture branch while the general production pin-ownership guard remains tied to the Docker ARG boundary.
- The #4434 patch uses the SRI-verified `openclaw@2026.6.10` artifact, fails closed on unknown or ambiguous formatter shapes, and is applied/audited against the real distribution in CI. A second generated-file hash allowlist would duplicate the package SRI plus shape audit and is deferred unless a future patch can no longer identify one unambiguous formatter boundary.
- Each OpenClaw `messaging-build-applier.mts --agent openclaw` Dockerfile phase receives `OPENCLAW_VERSION="${OPENCLAW_VERSION}"` from the Dockerfile build arg before rendering or installing messaging plugins.
- The integrity pin, messaging render-safety, and provider-recovery follow-ups are covered by the integrity-pin suites, `test/runtime/messaging/messaging-build-applier-render-safety.test.ts`, and `test/onboarding/onboard-resume-provider-recovery.test.ts`.
