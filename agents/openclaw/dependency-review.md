# OpenClaw MCP Runtime Dependency Review

This file records the reviewed `mcporter` baseline installed in the OpenClaw sandbox image.
Update it and `agents/openclaw/mcporter-runtime/package*.json` together whenever `MCPORTER_VERSION`, its integrity value, a manifest override, or the locked graph changes in `Dockerfile.base` or `Dockerfile`.

- Package: `mcporter@0.7.3`
- Purpose: in-sandbox OpenClaw MCP configuration and client adapter; it is not a host bridge, proxy, relay, or listener.
- Registry source: `https://registry.npmjs.org/mcporter/-/mcporter-0.7.3.tgz`
- Repository: `https://github.com/steipete/mcporter`
- License: `MIT`, from the npm registry package metadata.
- npm integrity: `sha512-egoPVYqTnWb3NjRIxo+xc8OrAI0dlPrJm9pAiZx0pImuNIV5rKhGtTnIfH/Y1ldGPVu74ibj3KR5c9U/QSdQFA==`
- Registry metadata independently queried from npm: 2026-06-30.
- Locked graph: `agents/openclaw/mcporter-runtime/package-lock.json` (npm lockfile version 3).
- Lock regeneration command: `npm --prefix agents/openclaw/mcporter-runtime install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts --omit=dev`
- Advisory command: `npm --prefix agents/openclaw/mcporter-runtime ci --ignore-scripts --omit=dev && node --experimental-strip-types scripts/lib/reviewed-npm-audit.mts --directory agents/openclaw/mcporter-runtime --exceptions ci/npm-audit-exceptions.json --graph mcporter-runtime --threshold high && npm --prefix agents/openclaw/mcporter-runtime audit signatures`
- Advisory review date: 2026-08-11.
- Advisory result: `0` known vulnerabilities across the resolved production dependency graph. npm verified registry signatures for all `120` resolved packages and attestations for `14` packages.
- Security override: `@hono/node-server@2.0.11` (`sha512-bjD221KPLoJTWUwso1J6fGKiTXEUFedG/s0visavY4zakFPkeGURMRNly+FhBHs7T8Dz4qHaZIMX9ZoJHSJtKA==`) replaces the SDK's vulnerable `1.19.14` resolution for `GHSA-frvp-7c67-39w9` and the previously reviewed `2.0.5` resolution affected by `GHSA-9mqv-5hh9-4cgg`. `2.0.5` is the first patched release for `GHSA-frvp-7c67-39w9`. The reviewed v2 range retains the `getRequestListener` API used by `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`; its Node.js 20 floor is below NemoClaw's Node.js 22.19 floor, and the `/vercel` adapter is not consumed. Mcporter's production path imports the SDK's client transport, not the server adapter, and the image build still exercises the installed CLI after the locked install. Remove the override when the SDK's declared range resolves to a reviewed release outside both affected ranges.
- Security override: `fast-uri@3.1.6` (`sha512-7Ical1vFEMr0onbVzEDIreM22I4khW+fzyQPwvAFWBp1iwdshSZRsL4jjRvPG9JP1uiqMHRto+YU6R2/CzDz5Q==`) replaces Ajv's vulnerable resolution. `GHSA-5jgf-p345-68v8`, `GHSA-f65p-4m7j-42xc`, `GHSA-fph4-wmhf-6fwf`, and `GHSA-jqff-g426-hqxp` affect earlier 3.x releases; `3.1.6` is the first patched release for all four. The replacement remains within Ajv's declared `^3.0.1` range, preserves the reviewed v3 API boundary, and also remains outside the older `GHSA-v2hh-gcrm-f6hx` and `GHSA-7p8r-x3mc-p8w7` ranges. Remove the override when the declared graph resolves to a reviewed release outside all affected ranges.
- Security override: `hono@4.12.34` (`sha512-GqXJqY/xJkJmuloTrnV1ZEXG3fqte+VjkUqoRNZXcrUidiUOP4fMSIHHY4tsqZBK++kVyWmt/AAfSUuy57/eSA==`) replaces the SDK's vulnerable `4.12.27` resolution.
  `GHSA-8j4g-w8fx-2239`, `GHSA-54fx-42gc-7vw4`, `GHSA-f23p-vx2j-j53r`, and `GHSA-79qm-7rj5-m7r9` are fixed in `4.12.34`.
  The replacement remains within the SDK's declared `^4.11.4` range and preserves Hono's Node.js `>=16.9.0` contract.
  Before removing or advancing the override, review the replacement and update the exact-version source-of-truth boundary, lock digests, and regression tests together.
- Security override: `ip-address@10.3.1` (`sha512-1e9d3kb97NHJTIJDZW9rKqW2h6+dFa50Dy0fpPSMQp2ADje5gvKsXmdiK6dwY5t76TaTt5+P5N1Y/LoToIxP6g==`) replaces `express-rate-limit`'s vulnerable `10.2.0` resolution. `GHSA-mwp4-54f8-5fhr` affects releases through `10.3.0`; the replacement remains within the declared `^10.2.0` range, adds the leading-zero IPv4 rejection and host-only subnet classification required for trust-boundary checks, and preserves Node `>= 12`. Remove the override when the declared graph resolves to a reviewed release outside the affected range.

Both image paths install the committed graph with `npm ci --ignore-scripts --omit=dev` because the published package declares no install-time lifecycle script and NemoClaw needs only its already-built CLI.
The reviewed audit wrapper reports lower-severity production findings and blocks unaccepted high or critical advisories. The default `ci/npm-audit-exceptions.json` registry is empty. Any future exception must match one advisory, graph, package, installed version, and severity; identify an owner and NemoClaw tracking issue; state a decision, rationale, and expiry no more than 30 days away; and include compensating controls for temporary risk acceptance. Missing, malformed, expired, overlong, mismatched, or unused exceptions fail closed. The repository-wide audit also rejects exceptions for unknown graph IDs. Registry signature verification remains a separate control.

## WeChat plugin runtime graph

- Package: `@tencent-weixin/openclaw-weixin@2.4.3`.
- Locked graph: `agents/openclaw/wechat-runtime/package-lock.json` (npm lockfile version 3).
- Lock regeneration: `npm install --package-lock-only --legacy-peer-deps --ignore-scripts --omit=dev --prefix agents/openclaw/wechat-runtime`.
- Installation boundary: the image materializes the reviewed lock into a root-owned dedicated npm cache and adds the exact package metadata needed by npm's offline resolver. Before that cache becomes immutable, the shared `scripts/lib/reviewed-npm-archive.mts` implementation re-packs every locked archive offline from the final cache and rejects registry-origin drift, metadata or packed-byte SRI drift, unsafe filenames, missing archives, and symlinks. The sandbox user copies that verified immutable source into a writable cache used for registry metadata lookup, archive packing, and the OpenClaw plugin install; no retrieval step falls back to `HOME/.npm`. The copy is deleted in the same image layer, and the trusted cache is never writable. The installer runs in offline, legacy-peer mode, then `verify-wechat-runtime-lock.mts` rejects integrity, version, dependency-set, or peer-range drift and refuses an image OpenClaw version below the plugin's locked peer minimum.
- Default CI gate: `wechat-runtime-audit` in `.github/workflows/pr.yaml` and `.github/workflows/main.yaml` invokes the reviewed `.github/actions/ci-wechat-runtime-audit` implementation.
  The pull request workflow resolves the action from the PR base SHA.
  If the PR base SHA does not contain the action, the pull request workflow fails.
  The `main.yaml` workflow uses the merged action.
  The action uses Node.js `22.19.0`.
  It downloads `npm@10.9.4` and verifies the archive against the committed Subresource Integrity (SRI) value.
  It installs the verified archive in npm offline mode with lifecycle scripts disabled.
  It materializes the committed graph with scripts disabled.
  The action rejects any low-or-higher production advisory and verifies registry signatures.
  The PR and main workflows upload the resulting reports.
  It also exercises the reviewed archive through a copied writable cache while the trusted source remains read-only.
  The action makes at most three `npm audit signatures` attempts.
  It retries a failed attempt only when the output contains `npm error Failed to download`.
  A failed attempt without this marker stops further attempts.
  Any final nonzero status fails the action.
  The report directory stores each attempt in `npm-audit-signatures-attempt-<n>.txt`.
  After a failed attempt, the action copies available npm debug logs to `npm-audit-signature-debug/`.
- Advisory command: `npm ci --ignore-scripts --omit=dev --legacy-peer-deps --prefix agents/openclaw/wechat-runtime && npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=low --json --prefix agents/openclaw/wechat-runtime && npm audit signatures --prefix agents/openclaw/wechat-runtime`.
- Advisory review: `2026-07-12`; result: `0` known vulnerabilities across the resolved production graph.
- Regression tests: `test/install/wechat-locked-install.test.ts` keeps the manifest runtime-lock paths and installer verification dispatch synchronized; `test/install/verify-wechat-runtime-lock.test.ts` proves the installed graph and OpenClaw peer-range compatibility fail closed; `test/automation/releases/wechat-runtime-audit-workflow.test.ts` keeps the Docker cache lifecycle, audit threshold, bounded download-only signature retry, invalid-signature denial, and real npm-pack boundary synchronized.

The dedicated graph intentionally omits the plugin's `openclaw` peer dependency. The image already installs and integrity-verifies the reviewed OpenClaw runtime separately; auto-installing another OpenClaw copy would create a second unreviewed runtime graph.
Disabling scripts also prevents transitive packages from executing lifecycle code during the trusted image build.
The lock records the exact version, registry URL, and integrity for every transitive package; the top-level registry integrity check remains an independent control.

## Source-of-Truth Boundary

- `invalidState`: the image installs a package graph, tarball, license, or advisory state that differs from the independently queried npm registry records for `mcporter@0.7.3`, resolves `@hono/node-server` to any version other than exact `2.0.11`, resolves `fast-uri` to any version other than exact `3.1.6`, resolves `hono` to any version other than exact `4.12.34`, or resolves `ip-address` to any version other than exact `10.3.1`.
- `sourceBoundary`: npm owns registry metadata, tarball integrity, provenance signatures, and advisory responses; NemoClaw owns the exact lock, script-disabled install, Docker integrity assertion, empty-by-default audit exception registry, and review record.
- `whyNotSourceFix`: a repository note cannot make external registry state trustworthy, so the required `reviewed-npm-audit` CI check materializes the exact locked production graph and verifies its registry signatures.
- `imageBuildBoundary`: image builds verify the committed lock, registry origin, tarball integrity, installed graph, lifecycle suppression, and reviewed advisory policy without connecting to Sigstore.
  The `schema=4` and `mcporter-recipe=locked-ci+reviewed-audit-v3` provenance values record this boundary.
  They do not attest that trusted CI verified registry signatures.
- `enforcementBoundary`: any nonzero `npm audit signatures` status fails the required CI check.
  The PR workflow requires this check before merge.
  The `pr-reviewed-npm-audit` job loads its audit implementation from the base branch revision and evaluates the dependency files from the commit under review.
  The managed-image build job requires that result before local builds and same-repository digest publication.
  The base-image workflow requires its audit result before it builds or publishes any base image.
  It also requires the result before it invokes managed-image publication.
  Final OpenClaw images reuse a matching installed runtime only from a digest-pinned base in the official GHCR namespace.
  The publication workflow gates that base on the check.
  A matching marker from a local base or mutable tag is package metadata without independent CI attestation.
  It cannot authorize reuse; the existing version checks reinstall the locked runtime or reject a newer base.
- `regressionTest`: `test/security/mcporter-supply-chain.test.ts` keeps the version, integrity, lock metadata, Docker install flags, image-build audit boundary, `reviewed-npm-audit` CI check, and this review synchronized.
  `test/inference/managed/managed-image-publication-workflow.test.ts` verifies that the base branch supplies the audit implementation, the commit under review supplies the input, and publication depends on the audit.
  `test/automation/releases/reviewed-npm-audit.test.ts` proves exact matching and fail-closed exception validation.
- `removalCondition`: remove this runtime dependency and review when OpenClaw provides the required authenticated Streamable HTTP client lifecycle without mcporter, or repeat the independent review for a newly pinned version.
