# Cut Release Tag

Use the release scripts for normal release operations. Do not run raw `git tag`, `git push`, `gh api`, or version-bump commands by hand for the normal release flow.

The release is one signed annotated semver tag on an already-merged `origin/main` commit. The GitHub workflow requires that tag to be GitHub-Verified, points `latest` at the exact verified tag object, carries remaining open issues/PRs to the next patch label, and deletes the released label while holding the shared release-label coordination queue; release admins promote `lkg` manually after validation. After the workflow is verified, draft release notes, then verify the maintainer-published Announcement before final handoff.

## LKG Production Image Dispatch

When a release admin creates or moves `lkg` to a commit carrying a `vX.Y.Z` tag, the `Release / LKG Brev Image` workflow dispatches the `Release Production Image` workflow in `brevdev/nemoclaw-image` on its `main` branch.
The dispatch passes the immutable semver tag instead of the mutable `lkg` tag.
The source workflow requires the `NEMOCLAW_IMAGE_DISPATCH_TOKEN` Actions secret with Actions read/write access to `brevdev/nemoclaw-image`; a missing secret fails before the API request, and the workflow summary never includes its value.
The trigger summary records the selected release tag, full commit SHA, target workflow, dispatch result, downstream run ID, and a direct link to the downstream run.
After `lkg` promotion, find and wait for the source trigger run using the promoted commit:

```bash
gh run list --repo NVIDIA/NemoClaw --workflow release-lkg-brev-image.yaml --commit <lkg-commit> --event push --limit 1 --json databaseId,status,conclusion,url
gh run watch <source-run-id> --repo NVIDIA/NemoClaw --exit-status
gh run view <source-run-id> --repo NVIDIA/NemoClaw --log
```

Extract the exact `https://github.com/brevdev/nemoclaw-image/actions/runs/<run-id>` URL printed by the source run, give that link to the maintainer immediately, and tell them to follow it to terminal success.
Treat dispatch acceptance as an intermediate state, not proof of production image promotion: the downstream run must succeed and its summary must show successful runtime E2E validation and promotion of the `nemoclaw-brev-cpu` image family.
A rejected dispatch fails the trigger run but does not move or roll back `lkg`.
Deleting `lkg` does not dispatch an image build.
The downstream scheduled reconciliation remains available if the event-driven dispatch fails or is delayed.

## Hard Rules

- Tag only the commit captured in a generated release plan.
- Do not generate the release plan until the release-prep docs PR containing `docs/changelog/YYYY-MM-DD.mdx` and the exact planned `## vX.Y.Z` heading is merged or explicitly waived.
- Treat the dated MDX entry as the canonical release history. A conventional Release Notes page or post-tag Announcement draft cannot replace it.
- If `origin/main` changes after plan generation, regenerate the plan before cutting the tag.
- Before asking for release confirmation, satisfy the canonical [pre-tag E2E evidence policy](../nemoclaw-maintainer-policies/references/release-train.md#pre-tag-e2e-evidence) for that commit.
- Use a passing `Release qualification` check from a full pre-tag run, with or without an administrator-authorized job waiver.
- Let `scripts/release-cut-tag.sh` perform the final canonical GitHub evidence check before a signing preflight or tag push.
- Ask the maintainer to paste the confirmation phrase from the plan before cutting the tag.
- Push only the semver tag (`vX.Y.Z`) from the agent-controlled step.
- Never push `latest` or `lkg` from this skill.
- Never move, delete, or force-push an existing remote semver tag unless the maintainer explicitly starts protected-tag remediation.
- Delete the released version label only after open work moves forward and a final query finds no open stragglers. Never rename or reuse a released label.
- Keep label retirement inside the `release-latest-tag` workflow so it cannot overlap the post-merge labeler. Do not run the retirement script directly.
- Draft release notes locally. Do not create the GitHub Discussion; the maintainer does that.
- Do not mark the announcement step complete until the maintainer provides a valid Discussion URL and the published Announcement is verified.
- Follow the shared [Git and GitHub Access Hard Stop](../_shared/git-github-hard-stop.md) for SSH, authentication, remote access, authorization, or permission failures.

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and update it as you proceed:

```text
Release Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Preflight and generate release plan
- [ ] Step 2: Show plan, E2E evidence, and confirmation phrase
- [ ] Step 3: Cut the semver tag from the confirmed plan
- [ ] Step 4: Wait for workflow-managed latest
- [ ] Step 5: Carry open work forward and retire the released label
- [ ] Step 6: Generate release-note data and draft Markdown
- [ ] Step 7: Wait for maintainer-published Announcement
- [ ] Step 8: Verify Announcement and hand off sharing
```

### Step 1: Preflight and Generate Release Plan

Start with one read-only pass that checks these prerequisites together:

- refresh `origin/main` and resolve its full SHA;
- check the target changelog heading and release-prep docs state; and
- inventory existing E2E runs for the same SHA before deciding what to dispatch.

Do not wait for merges to stop. The plan captures one candidate SHA for evidence; a late drift check advances it when `origin/main` moves.
Do not dispatch or poll a workflow during this pass.

Before this step, confirm release-prep docs are merged or explicitly waived.
Return to `nemoclaw-maintainer-evening` if docs are still pending.

For the planned version, inspect `origin/main` before generating the plan:

```bash
git grep -n '^## vX\.Y\.Z$' origin/main -- 'docs/changelog/*.mdx'
```

Require exactly one match in a dated file directly under `docs/changelog/`.
Confirm that a newly created file begins with the parser-safe MDX SPDX comment and that the entry contains its summary and detailed bullets.
If the entry is missing or malformed, return to `nemoclaw-contributor-update-docs`; do not substitute the post-tag announcement workflow.
If the maintainer explicitly waives the entry, preserve the reason in the release-plan presentation and confirmation handoff.

Run one of:

```bash
npm run release:plan -- --bump patch
npm run release:plan -- --bump minor
npm run release:plan -- --bump major
```

Patch is the default if the maintainer says "yes", "go", or similar without choosing.

The script writes a plan outside the checkout root, for example:

```text
../nemoclaw-release-v0.0.58/plan.json
```

### Step 2: Show Plan, E2E Evidence, and Ask for Confirmation

Read the generated `plan.json` and show the maintainer:

- previous tag,
- next tag,
- target `origin/main` commit and headline,
- plan hash,
- forbidden operations,
- confirmation phrase,
- open issue/PR housekeeping plan for the release label, including deletion of the released label after carry-forward succeeds.

Unless Step 1 records an explicit waiver, verify that the plan's next tag matches the H2 version heading in the dated changelog entry at the candidate SHA.
When the entry is waived, show the recorded waiver reason in the plan presentation and confirmation handoff instead.

For the plan's full `origin/main` SHA, require a completed, successful `Release qualification` check from a pre-tag `.github/workflows/e2e.yaml` run.
The workflow planner derives the required jobs from the workflow's E2E metadata.
By default, the check requires every release-required execution result, including `Publish staging Brev Launchable image`, to succeed.
A repository administrator may waive one or more release-required E2E execution jobs for a documented release exception.
The waiver requires a comma-separated `release_qualification_waived_jobs` list and a `release_qualification_waiver_reason`.
The reason must begin with an ASCII letter or digit and contain 10-500 characters chosen from ASCII letters, digits, spaces, and `.,:;/_()'-`.
Both inputs must be nonempty, or both inputs must be empty.
Both `github.actor` and `github.triggering_actor` must have repository `admin` permission.
Trusted controller jobs cannot be waived.
The trusted planner validates the job IDs and removes only those jobs from `release_required_jobs`.
Every waived job still runs, and `include_staging_brev_launchable=true` remains required.
Push runs publish `Relevant E2E` and are not release evidence.
Do not maintain a second release-gating list.
The release qualification waiver artifact is the sole artifact allowed to bind a failed workflow to planner-validated waived job results.

Use an existing qualifying pre-tag run for the candidate SHA when one exists.
If no qualifying run exists, load `nemoclaw-maintainer-e2e` and dispatch one full run with:

- empty selectors;
- `include_staging_brev_launchable=true`;
- `allow_jetson_dispatch=false`; and
- `allow_dgx_spark_runner_queue=false`.

Monitor the dispatched correlation ID with bounded status queries, then require its `Release qualification` job to succeed.

When a repository administrator explicitly authorizes a job waiver, use the waiver mode in `nemoclaw-maintainer-e2e`.
Keep both selectors empty and set:

- `include_staging_brev_launchable=true`;
- `release_qualification_waived_jobs` to the approved comma-separated job IDs;
- `release_qualification_waiver_reason` to the recorded reason in the allowed format;
- `allow_jetson_dispatch=false`; and
- `allow_dgx_spark_runner_queue=false`.

Require the `generate-matrix` dispatch receipt, written after waiver authorization and before that job's source checkout, to record the requested job IDs, reason, both actor identities, and candidate SHA.
Require the `Release qualification` summary and waiver artifact to record the planner-validated canonical job IDs and each waived job's completed outcome.
The successful check confirms that every unwaived release-required job passed.
A normal full run must conclude with `success`.
An administrator-waived full run may conclude with `failure` when a waived execution job fails, `Release qualification` succeeds, and the waiver artifact binds that failure to the candidate, run, actors, reason, and canonical waived job IDs.

Before showing the confirmation prompt, present the candidate SHA, workflow URL, and `Release qualification` job URL.
For a waived run, also present the waived jobs, their outcomes, the waiver reason, and both recorded actor identities.
No release-note-only delta exception is currently defined.

After image publication succeeds, present this advisory manual validation:

- State that the image-publication job built and published the candidate image to the staging family used by the [NemoClaw staging Launchable](https://brev.nvidia.com/launchable/deploy/now?launchableID=env-3GdbIjswX4fs3VJ6cYRHr5zoQXo).
- Encourage the maintainer to deploy one instance and hand its Brev environment URL to a Codex session that invokes `nemoclaw-maintainer-validate-launchable`.
- Require the manual validation to compare the deployed concrete image with `launchable-image.json`; do not assume that the mutable family still points to the candidate.
- State that browser-control capability is required for Codex to click and verify the web interface.
- State that a securely supplied inference credential is required to complete hosted and sandbox inference validation. Never ask the maintainer to paste the credential into chat.
- Record the manual result as `complete pass`, `partially blocked`, `failed`, or `not run` when the maintainer provides it.

This manual validation is advisory while the automated Launchable path is blocked by issue #8924.
Its absence, partial result, or failure does not block the signing preflight, confirmation prompt, or release tag.
Do not describe successful image publication as successful Launchable, runtime, or inference validation.
Apply the temporary policy in [Pre-Tag E2E Evidence](../nemoclaw-maintainer-policies/references/release-train.md#temporary-staging-launchable-qualification-policy): NemoClaw maintainers own it while #8924 remains open, the successful exact image-publication job and artifact remain required release evidence under normal Actions retention, and the full automated lane returns only after a checksum-pinned Brev release passes deployment through verified cleanup on trusted `main`.

Run the release script's signing preflight before asking for confirmation:

```bash
npm run release:cut -- --plan <plan.json> --preflight-only
```

For the canonical `NVIDIA/NemoClaw` remote, the script first searches completed manual `.github/workflows/e2e.yaml` runs with conclusion `success` or `failure` at the exact planned commit.
It accepts the first successful run with exactly one completed, successful `Release qualification` job.
For a failed run, it also requires a valid exact-run waiver artifact with at least one canonical waived job failure.
A run with zero or multiple jobs of that name is not evidence.
The script fails closed when no qualifying run exists or GitHub cannot provide the evidence.
Local fixture remotes skip this production gate only when tests set `NEMOCLAW_RELEASE_ALLOW_NON_CANONICAL=1` and the shared classifier confirms a noncanonical origin.
Canonical-equivalent `NVIDIA/NemoClaw` remotes always run the gate, even when that override is set.
A local fixture cannot authorize a release.
Require status 0.
The preflight also creates and deletes one local temporary tag without pushing a ref.
Git selects the maintainer's configured OpenPGP, SSH, or X.509 signer.
If the script reports that `origin/main` moved, discard the earlier check, regenerate the plan, and require qualifying full manual E2E for the new SHA.
This does not freeze `main` or prevent merges.

Ask the maintainer to paste this phrase:

```text
CONFIRM RELEASE vX.Y.Z <full-origin-main-sha>
```

Do not proceed on a generic "yes" at this step.

### Step 3: Cut the Semver Tag

Run the cut script with the plan and the maintainer's phrase:

```bash
npm run release:cut -- --plan <plan.json> --confirm "CONFIRM RELEASE vX.Y.Z <full-origin-main-sha>"
```

The script verifies a clean worktree, unchanged origin remote and `origin/main`, canonical exact-SHA GitHub evidence, tag availability, target reachability, and remote peeled tag state.
It then creates and pushes the signed annotated tag using the configured signing key.
It writes:

```text
<release-dir>/cut-result.json
```

If the script fails because of SSH, authentication, remote access, authorization, or permissions, follow [Git and GitHub Access Hard Stop](../_shared/git-github-hard-stop.md). For other precondition failures, report the failed precondition and use the recovery guidance below. Do not improvise git commands.

### Step 4: Wait for Workflow-Managed `latest`

Run:

```bash
npm run release:wait-latest -- --plan <plan.json>
```

The script waits until `vX.Y.Z` and `latest` reference the same tag object, verifies both peel to the planned commit, and verifies `lkg` did not change from the plan. It writes:

```text
<release-dir>/latest-result.json
```

If it fails, report the failed workflow/status. Do not manually move `latest`.

### Step 5: Verify Carry-Forward and Label Retirement

The `release-latest-tag` workflow continues after moving `latest`: it moves every remaining open issue or PR carrying the released version to the next patch label, verifies none remain, and deletes the released label. The workflow and post-merge labeler share one queued concurrency group, so assignment cannot overlap the verification-and-delete window.

Find the workflow run started by Step 3 and wait for it to finish:

```bash
RELEASE_SHA="<full-origin-main-sha>"
mapfile -t RELEASE_RUN_IDS < <(
  gh run list --repo NVIDIA/NemoClaw --workflow release-latest-tag.yaml --limit 20 \
    --event push --commit "$RELEASE_SHA" --json databaseId --jq '.[].databaseId'
)
if (( ${#RELEASE_RUN_IDS[@]} != 1 )); then
  echo "Expected exactly one release-latest-tag push run for $RELEASE_SHA" >&2
  exit 1
fi
gh run watch "${RELEASE_RUN_IDS[0]}" --repo NVIDIA/NemoClaw --exit-status
```

This automatic post-tag housekeeping is covered by the release plan and confirmation in Step 2. Do not run `scripts/retire-release-label.mts` directly; doing so would bypass the coordination boundary.

Then verify the released version label no longer exists:

```bash
gh label list --repo NVIDIA/NemoClaw --search <released-version> --json name \
  --jq '.[] | select(.name == "<released-version>")'
```

The command must return no output. Never rename the released label into a future version; a future target must be a separately created label with its own GitHub identity.

Summarize:

- open issues/PRs moved to `<next-version>`;
- released label deleted;
- any items that need manual maintainer attention.

### Step 6: Generate Release-Note Data and Draft Markdown

Collect deterministic release-note input:

```bash
npm run release:notes-data -- --plan <plan.json>
```

This writes:

```text
<release-dir>/notes-data.json
```

If `notes-data.json` has `status: "partial"` or non-empty `pullRequestWarnings`, report the warnings and ask the maintainer whether to fetch/fill the missing PR metadata before drafting.

Load and follow `nemoclaw-maintainer-release-notes`, then use its output as the draft. Save only Markdown, outside the checkout root:

```text
<release-dir>/release-note-draft.md
```

Before continuing to Step 7, verify the draft has three lead paragraphs, categorized shipped changes, one what-changed-and-why-it-matters bullet with a visible `#NNNN` link for every included change, and thanks for external contributors only.

Do not create or update a GitHub Discussion.
Do not edit `docs/changelog/` in this post-tag step; the canonical entry must already be present in the tagged commit.

### Step 7: Wait for Maintainer-Published Announcement

Return:

- release tag,
- confirmed release commit,
- plan path and plan hash,
- `cut-result.json`, `latest-result.json`, and `notes-data.json` paths,
- Markdown draft path,
- issue/PR housekeeping summary,
- suggested discussion title: `NemoClaw <new-version> is out`.

Ask the maintainer to publish the draft in the `Announcements` Discussion category and return the resulting Discussion URL. Do not create or update the Discussion. Keep Step 7 in progress until the maintainer provides the URL.

### Step 8: Verify Announcement and Hand Off Sharing

Before making any network request, reject the maintainer-provided URL unless it matches `https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/discussions/<positive-integer>` with no query string or fragment. Only then open it using a read-only GitHub or web capability and verify:

- the title is `NemoClaw <new-version> is out`;
- the category is `Announcements`;
- the body preserves the draft's three lead paragraphs, category headings, every included PR link, comparison URL, and external contributor usernames; formatting-only edits are acceptable;
- the comparison link targets `<previous-version>...<new-version>` and visible PR links target `github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/pull/<number>`.

If the Announcement is valid, return its URL with the release artifacts and mark the release workflow complete. Remind the maintainer to share that Discussion URL in the appropriate external channels. Do not create a duplicate Announcement.

## Recovery

- Plan generation fails: fix the named precondition, then regenerate the plan.
- Planned changelog entry is missing or malformed: stop before plan generation and run the pre-tag `nemoclaw-contributor-update-docs` workflow. Use post-release recovery only when the tag already exists.
- Full-mode E2E waits in the Launchable concurrency queue: keep the run pending until the earlier Launchable image-publication job finishes.
- Full-mode E2E ran for another SHA: reject the run and dispatch full mode for the plan candidate SHA.
- No qualifying `Release qualification` exists: inspect the GitHub result and run pre-tag E2E for the planned SHA only when no qualifying run already exists. Use a job waiver only with explicit repository administrator authorization. Do not release until the release script accepts the canonical check.
- Launchable image publication fails: inspect `launchable-image.json` and the producer run, correct the failure, and rerun the affected work. Do not infer image publication from manual Launchable validation.
- Advisory Launchable validation is blocked or fails: record the exact partial result and continue the release flow. Do not convert the result into a release gate or an automated E2E pass.
- `origin/main` moved after plan generation: regenerate the plan and ask for the new confirmation phrase.
- Remote semver tag already exists: stop; do not retag unless the maintainer explicitly starts protected-tag remediation.
- Signing preflight fails: fix the reported Git signer or signing-key failure. Run the preflight again before requesting confirmation.
- `latest` workflow fails or times out: report the workflow/status; do not move `latest` manually.
- `latest` workflow rejects a rollback: keep `latest` unchanged, inspect the plan target commit, and regenerate the plan for the current `origin/main` tip if appropriate.
- `lkg` changed: stop and escalate to a release admin.
- Post-tag housekeeping fails: report the workflow error and list items still carrying the released label. After the failure is fixed, rerun `release-latest-tag.yaml` with `<released-version>` through `workflow_dispatch`; the promotion and retirement steps are idempotent, already-moved items no longer match the source label, and an already-deleted released label is treated as success. Do not run the retirement script outside the workflow.
- Announcement is not published yet: keep Step 7 in progress and return the draft path and suggested title; the tag and housekeeping remain complete.
- Announcement title, category, body, or links are wrong: ask the maintainer to edit the existing Discussion, then verify the same URL again. Do not create a replacement. After three failed verification attempts for the same Discussion, stop and escalate to a release admin.
- Announcement cannot be inspected: report the read failure and ask the maintainer to confirm access or provide a public URL; do not mark Step 8 complete.
