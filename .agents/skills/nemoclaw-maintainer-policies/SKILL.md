## Answering Workflow Questions

Read the related reference before you answer or apply policy.
Use plain language for maintainers. Distinguish Issue Type, PR type labels, `needs:*` labels, Project fields, close reasons, and release labels.
Do not invent labels, statuses, fields, release labels, or workflow states.
Follow the shared [Documentation Writing and Review](../_shared/documentation-writing-review.md)
contract for changed workflow guidance and maintainer-facing text.

For agent implementation, use `triage-instructions.md` as the payload contract.
Use `label-taxonomy.json` to validate allowed values.

Workflow answers must remain reference-backed. Do not encode alternate policy in this manifest.
