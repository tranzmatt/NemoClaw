# Verdict Template

Render the final scorecard with `scripts/render-verdict.py`. Below is the human-readable shape it produces.

```markdown
## PR Comparison Verdict — Issue #<issue>

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] <criterion 1, from issue body>
- [ ] <criterion 2, from issue body>
- [ ] <criterion 3, from comment by @user>

### Per-PR Scorecard

| Contributor compliance | pass | pass |
| Branch protection | pass | pass |
| Automated-review threads resolved | pass | fail (2 unresolved) |
| **Tier 1 — correctness** | | |
| Test exercises bug path | pass | pass |
| Comment-as-spec coverage | pass | yellow (misses ask 3) |
| Negative test coverage | fail | pass |
| Coverage shape | pass | pass |
| Refactor-vs-behavior scan | pass | pass |
| Mocking purity | pass | yellow |
| **Tier 2 — quality** | | |

### Behavior Coverage Matrix

| Criterion | PR #A | PR #B |
|---|---|---|
| <criterion 1> | covered | covered |
| <criterion 2> | covered | missing |
| <criterion 3> | missing | covered |

### Verdict: No clear winner — see scorecard for recommended action

Reasoning trace:
- PR #B failed Tier 0. Check `<name>` failed on `<short-sha>` after the force-push.
- PR #A scored 14.5. PR #B scored 9.0.
- PR #A misses criterion 3. PR #B contains the test at `<file>:<line>`, so PR #A needs a transfer before it can be selected.

### Suggested action

1. Confirm that PR #B contains the contributor's `Signed-off-by:` declaration. Do not add or copy that declaration on the contributor's behalf. If it is absent, leave the winner unset and ask the contributor.
2. Read the author name and email from the source commit. Never guess or substitute it. If no usable identity exists, leave the winner unset and ask the contributor.
3. Transfer the test from PR #B before merge. Prefer `git cherry-pick -S -x <source-sha>` so the source contributor remains the Git author.
4. If the work must be combined or reconstructed, add a `Co-authored-by: Name <email>` trailer using the verified source-commit identity.
5. Add `Supersedes #B` to PR #A's body and identify the transferred test.
6. Keep the replacement author's own DCO declaration in PR #A's body.
7. Confirm that every replacement commit appears as `Verified` in GitHub.
8. Verify the updated commits, attribution, and CI, then run the comparator again on the updated SHA.
9. Merge PR #A only if the new verdict selects it.
10. After PR #A merges, close PR #B with a comment that links to #A.

### Reasoning evidence
- CI: all 12 required checks passed on PR #A commit `<short-sha>`. On PR #B commit `<short-sha>`, `test-cli` failed at `<log-line>`.
- Tier 1.1 PR #A: The test at `<file>:<line-range>` asserts on `<output>`. The previous code returned `<wrong-output>`, so the assertion would have failed.
- Tier 1.3 PR #A fail: no test for empty-input edge case despite issue commenter raising it at `issue.comment.4`
- Attribution: PR #A carries `<contribution>` from PR #B. Its body names the source PR, and commit `<sha>` preserves `<contributor>` as Git author or co-author.
- ... <one entry per judgment> ...
```

Every judgment in the trace must include:

- File:line reference or SHA/log line
- The fact observed
- The inference made
- The score contributed (full / half / zero)

If the verdict is **degraded mode** ("Neither mergeable yet"), substitute the verdict block:

```markdown
### Verdict: Neither mergeable yet — PR #B is closer

**PR #A — ineligible:**
- Substantive: Rebase against current main (3 conflicts in `<file>`)
- Ineligible: The contributor gate failed. The author must fix each failure before another review.
  - Missing PR-body DCO declaration: update the PR body
  - Missing GitHub Verified commit history: replace the branch with compliant history

**PR #B — fix to merge:**
- Substantive: 5 unresolved CodeRabbit threads at `<thread-ids>`
- Substantive: macos-e2e check failing on test "<name>" at `<log-line>`

### Suggested action

1. Ask the PR #A author to fix each contributor-gate failure. Do not repair or approve the PR for the author.
2. Resolve the substantive failures in PR #B. Then, run this skill again to confirm the winner.
```
