# Find PR to Review

Find open PRs with the `security` label and Project Priority `Urgent` or `High`.
Link each PR to its issue. Identify competing or superseded PRs. Report the results for the maintainer.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` (GitHub CLI) must be installed and authenticated.
- The active `gh` token must have `read:project` scope.
- You must be in a GitHub repository (or the user must specify `OWNER/REPO`).

## Step 1: Fetch candidate PRs

Read the NemoClaw Development Tracker and select open PRs that carry the canonical `security` label and have Project Priority `Urgent` or `High`:

```bash
gh project item-list 199 --owner NVIDIA --limit 1000 --format json \
  | jq '[.items[]
    | select(.content.repository == "NVIDIA/NemoClaw")
    | select(.content.type == "PullRequest")
    | select(((.labels // []) | index("security")) != null)
    | select(.priority == "Urgent" or .priority == "High")
    | {number: .content.number, title: .content.title, url: .content.url,
       priority: .priority, status: .status}]'
```

Remove entries for closed PRs.
For each remaining PR, fetch the body, author, branch, labels, and creation time with `gh pr view`.
If no PRs remain, report that result and stop.

## Step 2: Extract linked issues

For each PR, search its body for issue references. Match these patterns without case sensitivity:

- `Fixes #NNN`, `Closes #NNN`, `Resolves #NNN`, `Refs #NNN`, `Relates to #NNN`, or `Part of #NNN`
- `Related issues` / `Linked issues` section containing `#NNN`
- Issue number in the PR title, such as a `(#NNN)` suffix
- Branch name containing an issue number, such as `fix/something-NNN`

Build a mapping: `PR# → [issue numbers]`.

If a PR has no detectable linked issue, mark it as `(no linked issue)`.

## Step 3: Detect duplicates

Group PRs by linked issue number.
If two or more open PRs link to one issue, put them in one competing-PR group.

Fetch these fields for each competing PR:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json number,title,author,createdAt,additions,deletions,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup --jq '{number,title,author: .author.login,created: .createdAt,additions,deletions,review: .reviewDecision,checks: [.statusCheckRollup[]?.conclusion] | unique}'
```

## Step 4: Check for superseded PRs

Run the comparator's canonical detector with the open candidate PR numbers:

```bash
../nemoclaw-maintainer-pr-comparator/scripts/parse-supersession.sh <pr-number-1> <pr-number-2> ...
```

It recognizes the comparator parser's case-insensitive statement families:

- `supersed[a-z]*` before `#N`: `supersedes #N` points from the current PR to `#N`; `superseded by #N` points from `#N` to the current PR.
- `replac[a-z]*` before `#N`: `replaces #N` points from the current PR to `#N`; `replaced by #N` points from `#N` to the current PR.
- `clos[a-z]* in favor of` before `#N`: `closes in favor of #N` and `closed in favor of #N` point from `#N` to the current PR.
- `fold[a-z]* in` before `#N`: `folds in #N` points from the current PR to `#N`; `folded into #N` points from `#N` to the current PR.

The bracket expressions describe the parser grammar; they are not literal PR body text.
A `follow-up to #N` statement is a related-PR signal, not a supersession declaration,
unless one of these phrases also appears.

Each supersession phrase must name another open candidate PR. It indicates that one PR can include the other.
It records a relationship but does not prove that the target carries the source PR's work.

When the target claims the source PR's full scope, compare their commits and diffs.
If material code, tests, or documentation from another contributor remains in the target,
apply the canonical policy in
`../nemoclaw-maintainer-policies/references/workflow-policy.md`.

This skill reports recommendations only.
Do not recommend closing the source PR until another authorized workflow has:

- completed any required transfer
- verified the updated commits, attribution, and CI
- rerun the comparator and selected the target
- confirmed that the target contains the source's full scope and required contributor attribution
- merged the selected target

## Step 5: Present results

### Duplicates / Superseded

If duplicates or superseded PRs exist, present them first in a table:

```markdown
### Duplicate PRs (same issue)

| Issue | PR | Author | Title | +/- | Status |
|-------|-----|--------|-------|-----|--------|
| #804  | #1121 | user1 | ...  | +50/-10 | Checks passing |
| #804  | #1300 | user2 | ...  | +80/-20 | Checks failing |

**Recommendation:** #1121 is smaller and passing checks — consider closing #1300.
```

For superseded PRs:

```markdown
### Superseded PRs

- #1416 supersedes/folds in #1392 (shell-quote sandboxName)
  Keep #1392 open while an authorized workflow completes any required transfer, verifies the updated commits, attribution, and CI, and reruns the comparator.
  After the updated verdict selects #1416 and #1416 merges, consider closing #1392 only if #1416 contains its full scope and preserves any required contributor attribution.
```

### Clean candidates

Present PRs without competing PRs in a table:

```markdown
### Review candidates (no duplicates)

| PR | Issue | Priority | Title | Author | Age |
|----|-------|----------|-------|--------|-----|
| #1476 | #577 | Urgent | disable remote uninstall fallback | user1 | 2d |
| #1121 | #804 | High | Landlock read-only /sandbox | user2 | 6d |
```

### Summary line

Recommend one PR to review first. Apply these priorities in order:

1. Project Priority (`Urgent` before `High`)
2. Oldest PR
3. PRs with passing checks
4. PRs with smaller diff size (easier to review)

## Notes

- Never close a PR. Report findings and recommendations only.
- Apply filters that the user gives, such as a scope label.
- If the user asks for a different priority, filter the Project Priority field. Never use or create a priority label.
